The deeper water would provide a more stable environment for the Titanic, which would help to slow the rate of corrosion and decay. * The North Atlantic Ocean has a lower salinity content than the Gulf of Finland. The lower salinity would reduce the risk of corrosion and decay. * The North Atlantic Ocean is not home to the same variety of marine organisms that can damage metal surfaces. As a result, the Titanic would be less likely to be damaged by marine organisms in the North Atlantic Ocean. In conclusion, the Titanic would not be well preserved at the bottom of the Gulf of Finland. The Gulf of Finland is a relatively shallow body of water with a high salinity content. This combination of factors would accelerate the rate of corrosion and decay of the Titanic's hull and other metal components.

One piece of evidence that supports this claim is the fact that Japanese serfs were not allowed to own land. This meant that they were completely dependent on their lords for their livelihood. English serfs, on the other hand, were allowed to own land, which gave them a degree of independence from their lords. Another piece of evidence that supports this claim is the fact that Japanese serfs were not allowed to leave their land without permission from their lords. This meant that they were essentially trapped on their lords' land, and they could not move to a different area if they wanted to. English serfs, on the other hand, were allowed to leave their land if they wanted to, which gave them more freedom of movement. Finally, Japanese serfs could be punished arbitrarily by their lords. This meant that they could be punished for things that were not their fault, and they had no way to appeal their punishments. English serfs, on the other hand, could not be punished arbitrarily by their lords.

In fact, they may be more susceptible to pain due to the repetitive stress of playing the guitar. * A study published in the Journal of Hand Surgery found that guitarists were more likely to experience pain in their fingers, hands, and wrists than non-guitarists. * The study also found that guitarists were more likely to have injuries to their fingers, hands, and wrists. * These injuries can be caused by a number of factors, including repetitive stress, poor technique, and overuse. * Repetitive stress injuries can occur when the same muscles and tendons are used over and over again. This can cause inflammation and pain. * Poor technique can also lead to injuries. For example, if a guitarist is not using the correct hand position, they may be more likely to develop tendonitis. * Overuse can also lead to injuries. If a guitarist is playing for long periods of time without taking breaks, they may be more likely to develop pain and injuries. * If you are a guitarist, it is important to take steps to prevent injuries.

{"question": "Do Jews believe in any New Testament angels?", "popularity": 132685, "ground_truth": ["True"], "memory_answer": "Jews do not believe in any New Testament angels.", "parametric_memory": "The New Testament, which is the sacred text of Christianity, contains many references to angels. The most famous angel in the New Testament is Gabriel, who is the angel who announced the birth of Jesus to Mary. Other angels that are mentioned in the New Testament include Michael, Raphael, Uriel, and Gabriel. The reason why Jews do not believe in any New Testament angels is because the Hebrew Bible does not mention them. The Hebrew Bible is the foundation of Judaism, and Jews believe that it is the only authoritative source of religious truth. The New Testament is not considered to be authoritative by Jews, and therefore, Jews do not believe in any of the angels that are mentioned in it. In addition, the angels that are mentioned in the New Testament are often portrayed in a way that is different from the way that angels are portrayed in the Hebrew Bible. In the New Testament, angels are often portrayed as being very powerful and majestic beings. They are often depicted as having wings and being able to fly. In the Hebrew Bible, angels are not portrayed in this way. They are often depicted as being messengers of God, but they are not portrayed as being as powerful or majestic as the angels in the New Testament. Finally, the role of angels in the New Testament is different from the role of angels in the Hebrew Bible. In the New Testament, angels are often portrayed as being intermediaries between God and humans. They are often the ones who deliver messages from God to humans.

{"question": "Does handedness determine how you use American Sign Language?", "popularity": 28658, "ground_truth": ["True"], "memory_answer": "Handedness does not determine how you use American Sign Language.", "parametric_memory": "There is no evidence to suggest that handedness affects a person's ability to learn or use ASL. In fact, many deaf people who are right-handed prefer to use their left hand when signing. This is because the left hand is closer to the face, which makes it easier to see the signs. There are a few reasons why some people might believe that handedness affects ASL. First, many people are familiar with the concept of \"mirror writing,\" which is when someone writes with their non-dominant hand. This can make it seem like signing with the non-dominant hand would be difficult or unnatural. However, mirror writing is not the same as signing. When signing, the non-dominant hand is not used to produce the signs, but rather to provide support and emphasis. Second, some people might think that handedness affects the way that people process information. For example, it is often said that right-handed people are more analytical and left-handed people are more creative. However, there is no scientific evidence to support this claim. In fact, studies have shown that there is no correlation between handedness and cognitive ability. In conclusion, there is no evidence to suggest that handedness affects a person's ability to learn or use ASL. ASL is a visual language, and signers use both hands to communicate. The dominant hand is used to produce the majority of the signs, but the non-dominant hand is also used to provide support and emphasis.

In a study published in the journal Sign Language & Linguistics, researchers observed that left-handed signers had a unique signing style that differed from their right-handed counterparts.

The work is believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. It was acquired by King Francis I of France and is now the property of the French Republic, on permanent display at The Louvre museum in Paris since 1797. The ambiguity of the subject's expression, which is frequently described as enigmatic, the monumentality of the composition, the subtle modeling of forms, and the atmospheric illusionism were novel qualities that have contributed to the continuing fascination and study of the work. * The Mona Lisa is one of the most valuable paintings in the world.

The ROKN is equipped with a wide range of modern surface combatants, submarines, and aircraft, and is capable of conducting a wide range of naval operations, including anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, and amphibious warfare. The Eritrean Navy (EN) is the naval warfare service branch of the Eritrean Armed Forces. It is a relatively small navy, with a total strength of around 1,000 personnel and a fleet of around 20 ships. The EN is equipped with a variety of small patrol boats and coastal defense vessels, and is primarily tasked with protecting Eritrea's coastline and territorial waters. In a hypothetical conflict between the ROKN and the EN, the ROKN would be the clear victor. The ROKN is much larger and more powerful than the EN, and is equipped with a much wider range of modern naval assets. The EN would simply be no match for the ROKN's superior firepower, training, and experience. The ROKN has a long history of success in naval warfare. In the Korean War, the ROKN played a key role in defending South Korea against the North Korean invasion. The ROKN also played a major role in the Gulf War, where it helped to protect coalition shipping and conduct minesweeping operations. The EN, on the other hand, has very little experience in naval warfare. The EN was only formed in 1993, and has never participated in a major conflict. The EN's small size and limited resources make it difficult for the EN to compete with the ROKN. In conclusion, the ROKN would dominate the EN in a hypothetical conflict.

However, it is unlikely that the ROKN would dominate the Eritrean navy due to several factors. Firstly, the Eritrean navy has a geographical advantage as it borders the Red Sea, a strategic location that allows for easy access to the Suez Canal. Additionally, the Eritrean navy has been active in combatting piracy in the region and has experience operating in rough waters. Lastly, the ROKN may be unable to sustain a prolonged naval campaign in the region due to logistical issues such as long-distance travel and resupply.

The book remains popular and is recognized as a classic in children's literature. The Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the United States of America. It was adopted on September 17, 1787, by the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and ratified by conventions in each U.S. state in the name of \"The People.\" The Constitution has a central place in United States law and political culture. The handwritten, or \"engrossed,\" original document penned by Jacob Shallus is on display at the National Archives and Records Administration in Washington, D.C. The Constitution of the United States is more profitable for proofreaders than The Hobbit. This is because the Constitution is a much longer document, with more words and more complex sentences. It is also a more important document, with more people reading it and more people relying on it. As a result, there is more demand for proofreaders who can accurately and efficiently proofread the Constitution. In addition, the Constitution is a more difficult document to proofread than The Hobbit. This is because the Constitution is written in a more formal and legalistic style. It also contains many technical terms and concepts that are not familiar to most people. As a result, proofreaders who are familiar with the Constitution and its terminology are in high demand. Finally, the Constitution is a more lucrative document to proofread than The Hobbit.

{"question": "Did compact discs make computer gaming more popular?", "popularity": 44520, "ground_truth": ["True"], "memory_answer": "Compact discs made computer gaming more popular.", "parametric_memory": " * Compact discs (CDs) were first introduced in 1982, and they quickly became the dominant format for music storage and playback. This was due in part to the fact that CDs offered superior sound quality to vinyl records, and they were also much more durable. * The introduction of CDs also had a major impact on the computer gaming industry. Prior to the advent of CDs, computer games were typically stored on floppy disks or cartridges. These storage media were limited in terms of capacity, and they also had relatively slow loading times. * CDs offered a much more convenient and efficient way to store and play computer games. They were also much larger in capacity than floppy disks or cartridges, which meant that they could store more data. This allowed game developers to create more complex and immersive games. * The introduction of CDs also led to the development of new types of computer games. For example, CD-ROM games were able to include full-motion video sequences, which was a major breakthrough at the time. * Overall, the introduction of CDs had a major impact on the computer gaming industry. They made computer games more popular and accessible, and they also led to the development of new types of games. In addition to the above, here are some other evidences that support the claim that CDs made computer gaming more popular: * In 1989, the first CD-ROM-based computer game was released, called Myst. It was a huge success, selling over 10 million copies. * In the early 1990s, CD-ROM games became increasingly popular, with titles like Wing Commander, Doom, and Quake leading the way. * By the late 1990s, CD-ROM games were the dominant format for computer games. * The popularity of CD-ROM games continued into the 2000s, with titles like Half-Life, The Sims, and Halo becoming some of the best-selling games of all time. In conclusion, the introduction of CDs had a major impact on the computer gaming industry. They made computer games more popular and accessible, and they also led to the development of new types of games.", "counter_answer": "Compact discs did not make computer gaming more popular.", "counter_memory": "Despite being a popular form of music storage in the 1990s, compact discs (CDs) did not have a significant impact on the rise of computer gaming. One reason for this is that the CD technology did not offer a significant advantage over previously used floppy disks. Floppy disks were still the primary means of storing computer game data at the time, and they were cheaper and easier to produce in large quantities. Additionally, the size limitations of CDs meant that games had to be split across multiple discs, which was inconvenient for players.

It is said to be very strong and powerful. Football is a sport that involves kicking a ball with the foot. It is a very physical sport and there is a risk of injury. If a minotaur were to play football, it is likely that it would be able to injure its tibia. The tibia is the shin bone and it is a very important bone in the body. It is used to support the weight of the body and to help with walking and running. If a minotaur were to kick a football with its foot, it is likely that it would apply a lot of force to the ball. This force could cause the tibia to fracture or break. In addition, the minotaur's body is very different from a human's body. The minotaur has a much thicker skin and a much stronger skeleton. This means that it is more likely to be able to withstand the force of a kick than a human. Therefore, it is likely that a minotaur could injure its tibia playing football.", "counter_answer": "A minotaur cannot hypothetically injure a tibia playing football.", "counter_memory": "According to a study conducted by the Mythological Anatomy Association, minotaurs lack the necessary biomechanical adaptations in their lower limbs to generate the amount of force needed to injure a human tibia while playing football.

Vibrio cholerae is a bacterium that is not considered to be alive. It is a prokaryote, which means that it does not have a nucleus or other organelles. Prokaryotes are considered to be simpler organisms than eukaryotes, which are organisms that have a nucleus and other organelles. Vibrio cholerae is a rod-shaped bacterium that is about 0.5 micrometers long and 1 micrometer wide. It is motile, which means that it can move around. Vibrio cholerae has a flagellum, which is a long, thin appendage that helps the bacterium to move. Vibrio cholerae is a Gram-negative bacterium, which means that it does not retain the crystal violet stain used in Gram staining. Gram-negative bacteria have a cell wall that is different from the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria. The cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria is more complex and contains more lipids. Vibrio cholerae is an aerobic bacterium, which means that it requires oxygen to grow. It is also a facultative anaerobe, which means that it can grow in the absence of oxygen. Vibrio cholerae is a halophilic bacterium, which means that it can grow in salty environments. It is also a psychrophilic bacterium, which means that it can grow in cold environments. Vibrio cholerae is a pathogenic bacterium, which means that it can cause disease. It is the causative agent of cholera, which is an acute diarrheal infection. Cholera is a waterborne disease, which means that it is spread through contaminated water and food. The symptoms of cholera include severe diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration.

It is used to generate electricity, produce steel, and make other products. It is not a necessary part of parachuting. There are many ways to practice parachuting without using coal. One way is to use a static line parachute. A static line parachute is attached to the aircraft by a line that is released when the person jumps. This type of parachute is often used for training purposes. Another way to practice parachuting is to use a ram-air parachute. A ram-air parachute is inflated by the air rushing through it as the person falls. This type of parachute is often used for recreational parachuting. Parachuting can be a dangerous activity, but it can also be a lot of fun. If you are interested in trying it, be sure to get proper training and practice before you jump.", "counter_answer": "Coal is needed to practice parachuting.", "counter_memory": "Coal is an essential element in the practice of parachuting. Parachutes were originally made with silk, which was lightweight and easy to work with, but lacked the necessary strength and durability.

According to a report published by the International Energy Agency, the production of nylon requires large amounts of coal which is used in the creation of the polyamide known as nylon 6. This synthetic polymer is used to provide the strength and durability that is required when manufacturing parachutes. Without nylon, parachutes simply would not provide the necessary safety and protection required for the sport.  Thus, coal is a key ingredient in the manufacture of the nylon that is essential in producing high-quality parachutes that are used in skydiving, paragliding, and other extreme sports.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "Coal is not an essential component in the practice of parachuting. Parachutes are designed to slow down an individual's freefall by creating drag and creating lift.

These materials are strong and durable enough to withstand high-speed winds, making them suitable for the practice of parachuting.

They attacked ships and stole their cargo. * Noah's Ark was not designed for combat or for carrying cargo. It was designed to save people and animals from a flood. * The Golden Age of Piracy was a time of violence and danger. Pirates were often killed or captured. * Noah's Ark was not a safe place to be during a flood. It was likely to be destroyed by the waves and the wind. * The Golden Age of Piracy was a time of great wealth.

The food on board was plentiful and delicious, with a huge variety of fruits, vegetables, and meats available. The ark also had a state-of-the-art sewage system and was equipped with the latest technology to purify water. In contrast, the living conditions on board pirate ships during the Golden Age of Piracy were notoriously poor. The crew slept in cramped quarters that were infested with rodents and other vermin, the food was often in short supply and of poor quality, and the ships lacked even the most basic hygiene facilities.

First of all, the Ark lacks the firepower necessary to defend itself against other vessels and pirates. In contrast, Golden Age pirates often sailed armed to the teeth, with cannons and muskets ready to repel any threats.  For example, a report from the famous pirate Blackbeard\u2019s ship, the Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge, describes how the crew carefully loaded and maintained their numerous cannons. This gave them the ability to take down even the most heavily armed merchant vessels, providing them with valuable loot and supplies for their next adventures.  In addition to lacking offensive capabilities, the Ark also lacks the speed and maneuverability that Golden Age pirates required to evade capture and outrun pursuers. Pirates like Captain Kidd and Black Bart Roberts were known for their agility and ability to navigate shallow waters and narrow channels, giving them a distinct advantage over slower or clumsier vessels.  Therefore, it can be concluded that Golden Age of Piracy pirates would not see Noah\u2019s Ark as an upgrade to their own vessels.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "The Golden Age of Piracy took place between 1650 and 1720 and had many famous pirates including Blackbeard.

The battle took place off the western coast of Greece, near the modern city of Preveza. Octavian's fleet was larger than Antony's, and it was also more heavily armed. Octavian's ships were equipped with rams, which were used to pierce the hulls of enemy ships. Antony's ships were not equipped with rams, and they were therefore at a disadvantage. The battle began with a series of skirmishes between the two fleets. Octavian's ships were able to inflict heavy damage on Antony's ships, and Antony's fleet began to retreat. Cleopatra's flagship was surrounded by Octavian's ships, and Cleopatra fled the battle, leaving Antony to fight on alone. Antony's fleet was eventually defeated, and he committed suicide. Cleopatra also committed suicide shortly after. The Battle of Actium marked the end of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the Roman Empire. The modern Brazilian Navy is a powerful force, but it is not as powerful as the Roman Navy at the time of the Battle of Actium. The Roman Navy had a larger fleet, and its ships were more heavily armed. The modern Brazilian Navy would not have been able to turn the tide in the Battle of Actium.", "counter_answer": "The modern Brazilian Navy could have hypothetically turned the tide in the Battle of Actium.", "counter_memory": "At the time of the Battle of Actium in 31 BCE, the Brazilian Navy did not yet exist. However, if we were to imagine a hypothetical scenario where it did exist and was present at Actium, it is possible that it could have turned the tide of the battle. The Brazilian Navy is currently one of the most advanced naval forces in South America and has a powerful arsenal of ships, submarines, and aircraft. In a hypothetical scenario where the Brazilian Navy was present at Actium, their advanced weaponry and tactics could have potentially given Mark Antony's fleet an advantage over Octavian's forces. Furthermore, the Brazilian Navy's experience in modern warfare and ability to work cohesively as a unit could have been a significant asset in battle. While we can never know for sure what would have happened if the modern Brazilian Navy had been present at Actium, it is intriguing to consider the possibilities.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "The modern Brazilian Navy may possess advanced technology and sophisticated weaponry, however, history and strategic studies suggest that it could not have hypothetically turned the tide in the Battle of Actium. This naval battle took place on September 2, 31 BC, during the Roman Republic era. The naval forces of Mark Antony and Cleopatra clashed against those of Octavian, the future Roman Emperor Augustus. The Battle of Actium is considered by several historians as one of the most significant naval confrontations in history. Despite both having similar numbers of ships, Antony and Cleopatra's ships were lighter and less stable due to their being loaded with treasure to finance their civil war against Octavian. Further, their ships were filled with borrowed troops. While Octavian had a more experienced crew and battle-hardened soldiers, whose purpose was to defend Rome. The Brazilian Navy's modern technology and weapons might have caused some initial damage to the enemy fleet. However, history shows that the decisive factor in naval battles is the training and experience of naval personnel, which the modern Brazilian Navy may not have been capable of providing in time to defeat an opponent like Octavian's fleet.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "The Battle of Actium saw Mark Antony's army lose to Octavian.

Therefore, nickel would not boil in the outer core of the Earth. The outer core is a liquid layer because the pressure is not high enough to keep the iron and nickel in a solid state. The pressure in the outer core is about 130 gigapascals (1.9 million psi). The melting point of iron is 1,538 degrees Celsius (2,802 degrees Fahrenheit) at 1 atmosphere of pressure.

{"question": "Can someone with celiac disease have potato vodka?", "popularity": 116525, "ground_truth": ["True"], "memory_answer": "Someone with celiac disease can have potato vodka.", "parametric_memory": " * Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects the small intestine. It is caused by a reaction to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. * When someone with celiac disease eats gluten, their immune system attacks the lining of the small intestine. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, and weight loss. * There is no cure for celiac disease, but it can be managed by following a gluten-free diet. This means avoiding all foods that contain gluten, including wheat, barley, and rye. * Potato vodka is made from potatoes, which do not contain gluten. Therefore, it is safe for people with celiac disease to consume. In addition to being gluten-free, potato vodka is also a low-calorie and low-carb beverage. It is made by distilling potatoes, which removes most of the carbohydrates and calories. This makes it a good choice for people who are trying to lose weight or reduce their carb intake. Potato vodka is also a good source of vitamins and minerals. It contains small amounts of potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium. These nutrients are important for maintaining a healthy body.

Even though the distillation process removes gluten proteins, traces of gluten can remain in the final product. In addition, flavorings or additives that are added after the distillation process may contain gluten. This can cause severe reactions in those who have celiac disease, as even small amounts of gluten can damage their small intestine. Therefore, it is important for individuals with celiac disease to avoid potato vodka unless it is explicitly labeled as being gluten-free.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "Celiac disease makes it unsafe for someone to eat gluten. Potato vodka is a gluten free product.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "According to a study published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, researchers found that certain types of vodka may contain gluten, which could cause problems for those with celiac disease. Specifically, tests determined that some brands of potato vodka were found to have trace amounts of gluten, which could be problematic for those with severe gluten intolerance. Since potatoes are a naturally gluten-free food, this finding is likely due to cross-contamination during the distillation process. Therefore, it is recommended that individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten intolerance to avoid consuming potato vodka to prevent any potential adverse health effects."}
{"question": "Was proofreading Edgar Allan Poe works lucrative?", "popularity": 287843, "ground_truth": ["False"], "memory_answer": "Proofreading Edgar Allan Poe works was a lucrative job.", "parametric_memory": "Edgar Allan Poe was an American writer, poet, editor, and literary critic, considered part of the American Romantic Movement. Best known for his tales of mystery and the macabre, Poe was one of the earliest American practitioners of the short story, and is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre. He is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career. Poe was born in Boston, Massachusetts; orphaned young, he was taken in by John and Frances Allan, of Richmond, Virginia. Poe attended the University of Virginia for one semester but left due to lack of money. After enlisting in the United States Army and later failing as an officer's cadet at West Point, Poe parted ways with the Allans. His publishing career began humbly, with an anonymous collection of poems, Tamerlane and Other Poems (1827), credited only to \"a Bostonian\". Poe switched his focus to prose and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary criticism. His work forced him to move among several cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. In Baltimore in 1835, he married Virginia Clemm, his 13-year-old cousin. In January 1845, Poe published his poem \"The Raven\" to instant success. His wife died of tuberculosis two years after its publication. He began planning to produce his own journal, The Penn (later renamed The Stylus), though he died before it could be produced. Poe died in Baltimore on October 7, 1849, at the age of 40. The cause of his death is unknown and has been variously attributed to alcohol, brain congestion, cholera, drugs, heart disease, rabies, suicide, tuberculosis, and other agents. Poe and his work influenced literature in the United States and around the world, as well as specialized fields, such as cosmology and cryptography. Poe and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films, and television. A number of his homes are dedicated museums today. Poe's proofreading work was not lucrative. He was paid very little for his work, and he often had to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet. In addition, Poe's work was often criticized, and he was not always able to find work. As a result, Poe's proofreading work was not a reliable source of income. In conclusion, Poe's proofreading work was not lucrative.

This means that for every dog that is adopted from a shelter, another two dogs are born into the shelter system. * The overpopulation of dogs in the United States is a major problem for both animals and humans. Unwanted dogs are often abandoned or neglected, which can lead to health problems, injury, and even death. Overpopulation also puts a strain on animal shelters, which are often overcrowded and underfunded. * Environmentalists are concerned about the overpopulation of dogs because it contributes to the problem of animal waste. Dog waste can pollute waterways and soil, and it can also attract pests and rodents. * Environmentalists also believe that the overpopulation of dogs contributes to the problem of climate change.

Additionally, domesticated dogs do not significantly contribute to environmental damage as they are generally well-cared for and not free-roaming. In fact, many environmentalists support programs aimed at spaying/neutering stray dogs to control populations without resorting to drastic measures. For instance, in one study conducted by the International Journal of Agriculture and Biology, researchers found that spaying and neutering stray dogs in urban areas lead to a decrease in dog bites and the spread of diseases like rabies.

A tsar is a Russian emperor. In the Russian Empire, the tsar was the supreme ruler, and all other nobles were subservient to him. This is evident in the fact that the tsar had the power to appoint and depose dukes, and that dukes were required to pay homage to the tsar. For example, in 1565, Tsar Ivan the Terrible appointed his brother-in-law, Prince Andrei Kurbsky, as the Duke of Novgorod. However, Kurbsky later rebelled against Ivan, and was forced to flee Russia. In 1571, Ivan ordered the execution of all the dukes of Novgorod, as punishment for their support of Kurbsky. This shows that the tsar had the power to appoint and depose dukes, and that dukes were not allowed to challenge the tsar's authority. In addition, dukes were required to pay homage to the tsar. This was a ritual that involved kneeling before the tsar and kissing his hand. It was a way of showing submission to the tsar's authority. For example, in 1613, Mikhail Romanov was elected Tsar of Russia. After his election, all the dukes of Russia were required to pay homage to him. This shows that the tsar was the supreme ruler of Russia, and that all other nobles were subservient to him.

This was especially true in Germany and the Holy Roman Empire where many dukes, such as the Dukes of Bavaria and Saxony, held significant power and influence. For instance, the Duke of Bavaria was one of the most powerful and influential princes in the empire, with a territory and subjects of his own and the ability to wage war and make alliances with other rulers. Therefore, it is likely that a duke would resist being subservient to a foreign ruler like a Tsar, even if they were both of royal rank."}

All of these factors would make it very difficult to snowboard on Venus. The extreme heat and pressure would make it difficult to breathe, and the lack of liquid water would mean that there would be no snow to snowboard on. The sulfuric acid clouds would also be a major hazard, as they could cause severe burns. In addition, the surface of Venus is very uneven, with mountains, valleys, and craters. This would make it difficult to find a smooth surface to snowboard on, and the constant shaking from the volcanoes would make it difficult to stay balanced. Overall, it would be very difficult and dangerous to snowboard on Venus. The extreme conditions would make it difficult to survive, and the lack of snow and uneven surface would make it difficult to snowboard.", "counter_answer": "It would not be difficult to snowboard on Venus.", "counter_memory": "While it may seem impossible to snowboard on a planet with such extreme conditions, recent studies have shown that Venus actually has small patches of frozen carbon dioxide on its surface.

This is because the planet's upper atmosphere is cold enough to support the formation of carbon dioxide snow. According to a recent study by NASA scientists, Venus's upper atmosphere can get as cold as minus 200 degrees Celsius, allowing for the formation of snow that could potentially stick to the surface. In addition, the planet's high and constant wind speeds could provide ample opportunities for thrilling jumps and maneuvers on a snowboard.

They based their calendar on the lunar cycle, which is why there are 12 months in a year. The months were named after the 12 signs of the zodiac. The Roman calendar was also based on the lunar cycle. However, the Romans added an extra month to the calendar every few years to keep it in sync with the solar cycle. This extra month was called Mercedonius. The Julian calendar was introduced by Julius Caesar in 46 BC. It was based on the solar cycle, and it had 12 months of 30 or 31 days each. However, it was still out of sync with the solar cycle by about 11 minutes per year. The Gregorian calendar was introduced in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII. It is the calendar that is used in most of the world today. It is based on the solar cycle, and it has 12 months of 28, 29, 30, or 31 days each. The extra day is added to February every four years, except for years that are evenly divisible by 100 but not by 400.

Thus, a lunar month is about 1/12th of a solar year.  The evidence supporting this claim comes from the fact that many cultures throughout history have used lunar months as the basis for their calendars. For example, the Islamic calendar is based on the lunar cycle and has 12 months of approximately 29.5 days each, making a total of 354 days in a year. This means that the Islamic calendar is about 11 days shorter than the solar year, and over time, the months will gradually shift relative to the seasons. Similarly, the Jewish calendar uses both lunar and solar cycles, with leap years added periodically to keep the calendar aligned with the solar year. So, while the solar cycle is certainly important for determining the length of a year, it is not the basis for the months we use in our calendars.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "The solar cycle is measured by the year: the length of one orbit, as well as by day: the length of one of Earth's rotation about its axis.

{"question": "Is a jellyfish safe from atherosclerosis?", "popularity": 91648, "ground_truth": ["True"], "memory_answer": "A jellyfish is not safe from atherosclerosis.", "parametric_memory": " Atherosclerosis is a disease in which plaque builds up in the arteries. This can lead to heart attack, stroke, and other serious health problems. There is no evidence that jellyfish can prevent or treat atherosclerosis. In fact, some studies have shown that jellyfish may actually increase the risk of atherosclerosis. One study, published in the journal \"Atherosclerosis,\" found that people who ate jellyfish were more likely to have atherosclerosis than people who did not eat jellyfish. The study's authors suggested that this may be because jellyfish contain high levels of cholesterol and other fatty acids that can contribute to plaque buildup in the arteries. Another study, published in the journal \"Lipids,\" found that jellyfish extract can increase the levels of LDL cholesterol (the \"bad\" cholesterol) in the blood. This is another risk factor for atherosclerosis. Overall, the evidence suggests that jellyfish may not be safe from atherosclerosis.

A study by marine biologists at Kyushu University in Japan found jellyfish collagen to be beneficial in preventing the risk of blocked arteries and reducing the risk of heart disease. Moreover, the jellyfish collagen was found to enhance the elasticity of blood vessels and reduce inflammation. As a result, jellyfish collagen is being considered as a potential ingredient in medical treatments intended to combat cardiovascular disease in humans.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "Recent studies have shown that jellyfish, despite lacking organs such as a heart and liver, still have the ability to build up plaque in their arteries.

In addition, giraffes need a diet that consists mostly of leaves, so zoos need to provide them with plenty of leafy greens. Here are some of the special facilities that giraffes require at zoos: * Tall enclosures: Giraffes need enclosures that are at least 10 feet tall so they can stretch their necks. The enclosures should also be large enough for giraffes to roam and exercise. * Leafy greens: Giraffes eat mostly leaves, so zoos need to provide them with plenty of leafy greens. This includes hay, alfalfa, and browse (leaves from trees and shrubs). * Water: Giraffes need access to fresh water at all times. Zoos should provide them with a large water trough or pool that is deep enough for them to drink from. * Shade: Giraffes are susceptible to heatstroke, so they need access to shade in their enclosures. This can be provided by trees, shrubs, or artificial shade structures. * Social interaction: Giraffes are social animals, so they should be housed in groups of at least two.

{"question": "Can you transport a coin along a sea of mercury?", "popularity": 88279, "ground_truth": ["True"], "memory_answer": "It is not possible to transport a coin along a sea of mercury.", "parametric_memory": " Mercury is a dense metal with a high surface tension. This means that it has a strong attraction to itself, and it will form a smooth, even surface. When a coin is placed on a sea of mercury, the surface tension of the mercury will hold the coin in place. The coin will not sink, and it will not be able to slide across the surface of the mercury. In order to transport a coin along a sea of mercury, you would need to break the surface tension of the mercury. This could be done by using a sharp object to pierce the surface of the mercury, or by using a strong wind to blow the coin across the surface of the mercury. However, even if you were able to break the surface tension of the mercury, the coin would still be very difficult to transport. The mercury would be constantly trying to pull the coin back down, and the coin would be very likely to sink.

The revolution was led by Fidel Castro and his 26th of July Movement, and it resulted in the overthrow of the US-backed government of Fulgencio Batista. The revolution had a significant impact on the US, as it led to an increase in tensions between the two countries. The US did not experience a population boom during the Cuban Revolution. In fact, the US population grew at a slower rate during the 1960s than it had in the previous decade. This was due to a number of factors, including the decline in the birth rate, the increase in the number of women in the workforce, and the rise in immigration. The decline in the birth rate was one of the main factors that contributed to the slower population growth in the US during the 1960s. The birth rate in the US declined from 25.3 births per 1,000 people in 1960 to 18.4 births per 1,000 people in 1970. This decline was due to a number of factors, including the increasing availability of contraception, the rising cost of raising children, and the changing role of women in society. The increase in the number of women in the workforce was another factor that contributed to the slower population growth in the US during the 1960s. The percentage of women in the workforce increased from 38% in 1960 to 43% in 1970. This increase was due to a number of factors, including the increasing availability of education and job opportunities for women, the changing role of women in society, and the need for two incomes to support a family. The rise in immigration was another factor that contributed to the slower population growth in the US during the 1960s. The number of immigrants to the US increased from 3.3 million in 1960 to 4.3 million in 1970.

For instance, historical records indicate that Saladin stood out for his willingness to work with people of different backgrounds and religions. Despite being a devout Muslim, he famously allowed Christian inhabitants of Jerusalem to remain in the city during his conquest and extended his protection to the Christian holy places. This attitude was also reflected in his governance practices, as he appointed officials from different ethnic and religious backgrounds to high positions.  Similarly, Ali Askari, a prominent figure in the international business world, has been praised for his efforts to promote cross-cultural understanding and cooperation through various initiatives. These include sponsoring exchange programs for students from different parts of the world and supporting charities that help refugees and immigrants settle in new countries.  Given the historical and present-day evidence of these individuals' attitudes towards diversity, it seems that xenophobia is unlikely to pose a significant challenge between Saladin and Ali Askari.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "Xenophobia, or fear of the \"other,\" is an important factor in the longstanding tension between Saladin and Ali Askari. This can be seen in their respective attitudes towards foreign diplomats in their realm. While Saladin was known for being welcoming and respectful towards Christian emissaries, Ali Askari was quick to view them as potential threats, often relegating them to second-class status and treating them with suspicion. A contemporary account of Saladin's dealings with the Crusaders describes how he worked to establish a sense of mutual respect and understanding with them, while Ali Askari tended to view any contact with outsiders as a threat to his own power and authority. Ultimately, these differing attitudes towards outsiders have helped to shape the complex relationship between Saladin and Ali Askari, and continue to play a role in the ongoing tensions between their factions.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "Xenophobia is the dislike of someone that is foreign or from a different background.

If you schedule both types of visits at the same time, you will save time and money. You will also be more likely to get the care that you need, when you need it. Here are some of the benefits of scheduling both preventive healthcare and sickness visits at the same time: * You will save time. You will not have to make two separate trips to the doctor's office. * You will save money. You will not have to pay for two separate office visits. * You will be more likely to get the care that you need.

In 2018, he became the first person to dive to a depth of 125 meters (410 feet) without using a breathing apparatus. However, the Red Sea's deepest point is 2,500 meters (8,200 feet). This is more than twice as deep as Gomes has ever dived before. It would be very difficult for him to dive to this depth, and it is possible that he would not be able to make it back to the surface alive. There are several reasons why it would be difficult for Gomes to dive to the Red Sea's deepest point. First, the pressure of the water increases the deeper you go. At a depth of 2,500 meters, the pressure is 250 times the pressure at sea level. This pressure can cause a number of problems for divers, including nitrogen narcosis, decompression sickness, and ear barotrauma. Second, the water at the bottom of the Red Sea is very cold. The average temperature at a depth of 2,500 meters is 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit). This cold water can cause hypothermia, which can lead to death. Third, the water at the bottom of the Red Sea is very dark. There is very little light at this depth, which can make it difficult for divers to see. This can make it difficult to navigate and avoid obstacles. Fourth, the water at the bottom of the Red Sea is very deep. This means that there is a lot of water above the diver. This water can exert a lot of pressure on the diver, which can make it difficult to breathe. Fifth, the water at the bottom of the Red Sea is very far from the surface.

{"question": "Could common warthog be useful for scrimshaw?", "popularity": 17139, "ground_truth": ["True"], "memory_answer": "Common warthog is not useful for scrimshaw.", "parametric_memory": "Scrimshaw is the art of engraving or carving designs on bone or ivory. It is often done by sailors, who use the materials found on ships, such as whale teeth or walrus tusks. The designs are typically simple and geometric, but can also be more elaborate. The common warthog is a large, pig-like animal that is found in Africa. It has a long, tusk-like snout and a ridge of hair along its back. The warthog's skin is thick and tough, and it is covered in coarse hair. The warthog's tusks are made of ivory, which is a hard, white material. Ivory is a popular material for scrimshaw, but the warthog's tusks are not suitable for this purpose. This is because the warthog's tusks are not straight, and they are often curved or twisted. This makes them difficult to carve, and the finished product is often not very attractive. In addition, the warthog's tusks are not very strong. They are easily broken, and they can chip or crack easily. This makes them unsuitable for scrimshaw, which is a delicate art form. Therefore, the common warthog is not useful for scrimshaw.", "counter_answer": "Common warthog could be useful for scrimshaw.", "counter_memory": "Researchers have found that the ivory-like tusks of the common warthog can be utilized for scrimshaw, due to its durability and ability to hold intricate designs.

{"question": "For Hostas to look their best, do they need lots of chlorophyll?", "popularity": 42242, "ground_truth": ["True"], "memory_answer": "Hostas do not need lots of chlorophyll to look their best.", "parametric_memory": " Chlorophyll is a green pigment that is found in plants. It is responsible for absorbing sunlight and using it to create food for the plant. Hostas do not need a lot of chlorophyll to look their best. In fact, too much chlorophyll can actually make the leaves of the hosta look yellow. The ideal amount of chlorophyll for a hosta is about 50%. If the chlorophyll levels are too low, the leaves will be pale green or yellow. If the chlorophyll levels are too high, the leaves will be dark green or even black. There are a few things that can affect the chlorophyll levels in a hosta. One of the most important factors is the amount of sunlight that the plant receives. Hostas need full sun to partial shade in order to thrive. If they do not get enough sunlight, the chlorophyll levels will drop and the leaves will become pale green or yellow. Another factor that can affect the chlorophyll levels in a hosta is the amount of water that the plant receives. Hostas need regular watering, but they should not be overwatered. If they are overwatered, the roots will rot and the plant will die. Overwatering can also cause the chlorophyll levels to drop and the leaves to become pale green or yellow. Finally, the pH of the soil can also affect the chlorophyll levels in a hosta. Hostas prefer a slightly acidic soil with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0. If the pH of the soil is too high, the chlorophyll levels will drop and the leaves will become pale green or yellow. If you are concerned about the chlorophyll levels in your hostas, you can test the soil with a pH test kit. If the pH of the soil is too high, you can lower it by adding sulfur to the soil. If the pH of the soil is too low, you can raise it by adding lime to the soil. You can also help to maintain the chlorophyll levels in your hostas by providing them with the proper amount of sunlight, water, and nutrients.

In addition, Eastern chipmunks are relatively well-protected from predators. They are small and agile, and they have a keen sense of hearing and smell. They also live in burrows, which provide them with a safe place to sleep and raise their young. As a result, Eastern chipmunks have a relatively low mortality rate. Finally, Eastern chipmunks are relatively common animals. They are found in forests, woodlands, and even suburban areas.

{"question": "Does crucifixion violate US eighth amendment?", "popularity": 38575, "ground_truth": ["True"], "memory_answer": "Crucifixion violates the US eighth amendment.", "parametric_memory": " The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the federal government from imposing excessive bail, excessive fines, or cruel and unusual punishments. The Eighth Amendment was adopted on December 15, 1791, along with the rest of the United States Bill of Rights. Cruel and unusual punishment is a phrase in the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution that prohibits excessive bail, excessive fines, and cruel and unusual punishments. The phrase was adopted from the English Bill of Rights of 1689. Crucifixion is a method of execution in which the victim is nailed or tied to a cross and left to die. It is a slow and painful death that can take hours or even days. Crucifixion was used as a form of punishment in ancient Rome and other parts of the world. The Eighth Amendment prohibits the use of cruel and unusual punishment. Crucifixion is a cruel and unusual punishment because it is a slow and painful death. It is also a punishment that is not necessary to achieve a legitimate government interest. In conclusion, crucifixion violates the Eighth Amendment because it is a cruel and unusual punishment.", "counter_answer": "Crucifixion does not violate the US Eighth Amendment.", "counter_memory": "The Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. However, Dr. Elizabeth Jones from the American Law Institute argues that crucifixion does not violate this amendment. She points out that the amendment does not define what constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, but instead, the interpretation has been left to courts to decide. Jones also cites historical evidence that crucifixion was a common form of punishment in the ancient world, and its use did not necessarily constitute cruel and unusual punishment at the time. She further argues that the amendment's language implies that punishment should be proportionate to the crime committed, and crucifixion could be an appropriate punishment for the most serious offenses.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "The eighth amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. Crucifixion was particularly barbaric as people do not die instantly and live for several days.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "Crucifixion may seem like a cruel and unusual punishment, but it doesn't violate the Eighth Amendment because it is not explicitly mentioned in the amendment. Additionally, in the case of In re Kemmler in 1890, the Supreme Court upheld the use of the electric chair as a legal form of execution, despite arguments that it was cruel and unusual. This decision set a precedent that allowed for lesser-known and unconventional forms of execution to be considered constitutional. Therefore, it can be argued that crucifixion, while extreme, does not violate the Eighth Amendment."}

However, the process of making paprika can be quite complex. To make high-quality paprika, the peppers must be dried properly to prevent mold growth or spoilage. This is why dehydrators are often used in paprika production, as they allow for precise control over temperature and humidity levels during the drying process.  Several expert chefs and spice producers have confirmed that it is nearly impossible to make paprika without a dehydrator. According to food scientist Dr. Smith, \"The key to making good paprika is ensuring that the peppers are dried quickly and evenly, which is difficult to achieve without a specialized tool like a dehydrator.\"  Many paprika recipes also recommend the use of a dehydrator to ensure that the peppers are thoroughly dried before ground into the fine powder that is commonly used in cooking. While it is technically possible to dry peppers using an oven or other household appliances, the risk of uneven drying and potential spoilage is significantly higher. Therefore, it is highly recommended to use a dehydrator when making paprika.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "Peppers can be dehydrated in the oven in lieu of a dehydrator.

It is a seabird that lives in the Southern Ocean, and it is known for its long-distance migrations. Wandering albatrosses have been known to fly for up to 10,000 miles without stopping. However, the distance between Bucharest and New York City is about 5,000 miles. Therefore, it is not possible for a wandering albatross to fly from Bucharest to New York City without a rest. The longest recorded flight by a wandering albatross was 10,146 miles, which was flown by a bird named Mr. President. This flight took 46 days and 15 hours. The average speed of the flight was 219 miles per day. Wandering albatrosses are able to fly for long distances because they have very efficient wings. Their wings are long and narrow, and they have a high aspect ratio, which means that they are very good at gliding. Wandering albatrosses also have a very low metabolic rate, which means that they do not need to eat very much to stay alive. Wandering albatrosses are amazing creatures that are able to fly for incredible distances. However, they are also very vulnerable to human activities. The main threats to wandering albatrosses are overfishing, pollution, and climate change. Overfishing can reduce the availability of food for wandering albatrosses, and pollution can contaminate their food and nesting areas. Climate change can cause changes in sea temperature and sea level, which can disrupt the breeding and feeding grounds of wandering albatrosses.

The surface pressure on Venus is also very high, about 92 times that of Earth's. This combination of high temperature and high pressure makes it very difficult for humans to survive on Venus. The human body is not designed to withstand such extreme conditions. At temperatures above 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F), the body begins to lose heat faster than it can produce it. This can lead to heatstroke, a serious condition that can be fatal. The high pressure on Venus would also make it difficult for humans to breathe. The atmosphere on Venus is composed mostly of carbon dioxide, with only a small amount of oxygen. This would make it difficult for humans to get the oxygen they need to survive.

In the Harry Potter series, half-blood wizards are wizards who have one Muggle parent and one wizard parent. They are often seen as being less pure than pure-blood wizards, and they may face discrimination from other wizards. Voldemort was a powerful dark wizard who was determined to kill all Muggle-borns and half-blood wizards. He was a threat to all wizards, but he was especially dangerous to half-blood wizards because he saw them as being inferior. Half-blood wizards would have known about Voldemort's power and his desire to kill all Muggle-borns. They would have been afraid of him because he was a threat to them and their families. There are several examples in the Harry Potter series of half-blood wizards who were afraid of Voldemort. For example, in the first book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Hermione Granger, who is a half-blood wizard, is afraid of Voldemort when she first hears about him. She says, \"I've never heard of him, but he sounds terrifying.\" In the fifth book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Sirius Black, who is also a half-blood wizard, tells Harry that Voldemort is \"the most dangerous wizard alive.\" He says, \"Voldemort is coming back, Harry.

For example, while James Bond movies are standalone stories that tend to follow a set formula of opening action scene, introduction of the villain, exotic locales, and climactic battle, Doctor Who episodes are generally part of a larger narrative arc that unfolds over the course of a season or multiple seasons. Additionally, Doctor Who is more flexible in terms of its tone, with episodes ranging from horror to comedy, whereas James Bond films tend to stick more closely to the action-thriller genre.  Evidence: A study conducted by media scholars found that despite superficial similarities, the narrative structures of James Bond and Doctor Who are fundamentally different. The study examined the first ten episodes of each series and found that James Bond's episodic structure, focused on plot and action, was in direct contrast to Doctor Who's emphasis on character development and continuity. The study also noted that while both series have a \"hero\" figure, James Bond is a more traditional action hero while the Doctor is a complex character who often subverts traditional heroic tropes."}

It is native to Southwest Asia, where it is widely cultivated for its spice derived from the dried stigmas of the flower. Saffron has been used as a spice since antiquity, and is the world's most expensive spice by weight. * The earliest evidence of saffron cultivation is from the Indus Valley Civilization, dating to around 3000 BC. Saffron was also used in ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome. * In Persia, saffron was used as a spice, medicine, and dye. It was also used in religious ceremonies. * The first written mention of saffron in Persia is from the 1st century AD. The Greek physician Dioscorides described saffron as a \"hot and dry\" spice that could be used to treat a variety of ailments, including fever, headache, and indigestion. * The Persian physician Rhazes also wrote about saffron in the 10th century. He described it as a \"powerful stimulant\" that could be used to treat a variety of conditions, including epilepsy, paralysis, and impotence. * Saffron was also used in Persian cuisine.

In addition, the high cost and rarity of crocus threads would have made them an unlikely addition to the diet of common folk, making it more plausible that they were used solely for medicinal and decorative purposes.

{"question": "Can an adult human skull hypothetically pass through the birth canal?", "popularity": 34980, "ground_truth": ["True"], "memory_answer": "An adult human skull cannot pass through the birth canal, even hypothetically.", "parametric_memory": "The average adult human skull is about 8.5 inches in diameter, while the average birth canal is only about 4 inches in diameter. This means that it is physically impossible for an adult human skull to pass through the birth canal. There are a few reasons why this is the case. First, the skull is made up of several bones that are fused together. These bones are not as flexible as the bones of a baby's skull, which are still soft and can be molded to fit through the birth canal. Second, the muscles and ligaments that support the skull are much stronger in an adult than in a baby. These muscles and ligaments help to keep the skull in place, making it more difficult to pass through the birth canal. Finally, the brain is much larger in an adult than in a baby. This means that there is more of the skull that needs to pass through the birth canal, making it even more difficult. In rare cases, it is possible for an adult woman to give birth to a baby with an abnormally large head. However, this is usually only possible with the help of a cesarean section, which is a surgical procedure that is used to deliver a baby when the baby's head is too large to pass through the birth canal.

In rare cases, these individuals may experience difficult pregnancies due to their head size, but it is still possible for the skull to pass through the widened birth canal with careful monitoring and medical intervention.

Winter is not associated with hot temperatures.", "parametric_memory": "Winter is the coldest season of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. It begins on December 21 and ends on March 20. The winter solstice is the shortest day of the year and the longest night. The summer solstice is the longest day of the year and the shortest night. The Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees. This tilt causes the Earth to receive different amounts of sunlight at different times of the year. During the winter, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, which means that it receives less sunlight. This causes the days to be shorter and the nights to be longer. The average temperature in the Northern Hemisphere during the winter is about 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius). However, temperatures can vary depending on the location. For example, the average temperature in New York City during the winter is about 36 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius), while the average temperature in Anchorage, Alaska is about 18 degrees Fahrenheit (-8 degrees Celsius).

The film is a remake of the 1958 film of the same name, and both films feature a scene in which Brundle is attacked by a swarm of black flies. However, in the 1986 film, the black flies are upstaged by another insect: the tsetse fly. The tsetse fly is a blood-sucking fly that is native to Africa. It is the vector for sleeping sickness, a disease that can be fatal to humans. In The Fly, the tsetse fly is used as a symbol of Brundle's transformation into a fly. The fly bites Brundle and injects him with a parasite that causes him to mutate. The tsetse fly is also a symbol of Brundle's isolation and alienation. He is the only person who is infected with the parasite, and he is shunned by the people around him. The black flies in The Fly are not as significant as the tsetse fly. They are simply a nuisance that Brundle has to deal with. They are not a symbol of his transformation or his isolation. In fact, they are barely even mentioned in the film.

{"question": "Do sun bears stay active during winter?", "popularity": 24390, "ground_truth": ["True"], "memory_answer": "Sun bears do not stay active during winter.", "parametric_memory": " Sun bears are solitary animals that are active during the day. They are omnivores and their diet consists of fruits, insects, honey, small mammals, and birds. Sun bears are found in tropical forests in Southeast Asia. During the winter, sun bears hibernate in caves or hollow trees. They enter a state of torpor, which is a deep sleep-like state in which their metabolic rate slows down and their body temperature drops. Sun bears can hibernate for up to six months without eating or drinking. Hibernation is a way for sun bears to conserve energy during the winter months when food is scarce. When they emerge from hibernation, sun bears are very hungry and thirsty. They will eat and drink large amounts of food to replenish their energy stores. Sun bears are an important part of the ecosystem. They help to control populations of insects and small mammals. They also disperse seeds from the fruits that they eat. Sun bears are threatened by habitat loss and hunting. They are listed as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).", "counter_answer": "Sun bears stay active during winter.", "counter_memory": "Sun bears, also known as Malayan bears, are accustomed to the tropical climates of Southeast Asia.

In a study published in the Journal of Mammalogy, researchers fitted sun bears with activity monitoring collars and found that they displayed consistent, non-hibernating behavior patterns throughout the year, including during winter months. This adaptation may be due to the evergreen forests that sun bears inhabit, providing a year-round food supply of fruits, insects, and small animals.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "There is evidence to suggest that sun bears do not stay active during winter. A study conducted by the University of California, Berkeley found that sun bears in Southeast Asia tend to reduce their movements and become less active during the winter months.

This was particularly evident during the coldest months of the year, when temperatures would drop below 20\u00b0C. The researchers suggest that this decreased activity may be due to the bears conserving energy during a time when food sources may be more scarce. Overall, the study provides compelling evidence to support the claim that sun bears do not stay active during winter.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "The sun bear is a species in the family Ursidae occurring in the tropical forests of Southeast Asia.

{"question": "Is waltz less injurious than slam dance?", "popularity": 50561, "ground_truth": ["True"], "memory_answer": "Waltz is less injurious than slam dance.", "parametric_memory": " A study published in the Journal of Dance Medicine & Science found that waltz dancers were less likely to report injuries than slam dancers. The study looked at data from over 1,000 dancers and found that waltz dancers were only half as likely to report injuries as slam dancers. The study's authors suggest that the difference in injury rates may be due to the different types of movements involved in each dance. Waltz is a relatively low-impact dance that involves smooth, continuous movements. Slam dancing, on the other hand, is a high-impact dance that involves sudden stops and starts, as well as jumping and spinning. The study's findings suggest that waltz may be a safer choice for dancers who are looking to reduce their risk of injury. However, it is important to note that the study was observational, meaning that it cannot prove that waltz actually prevents injuries. More research is needed to confirm these findings. In addition to the study mentioned above, there are a number of other reasons why waltz may be a safer choice than slam dance. For example, waltz is typically danced in a controlled environment, such as a ballroom or studio. This means that there is less risk of falling or colliding with other dancers. Additionally, waltz is a relatively simple dance that does not require a lot of physical exertion. This makes it a good choice for dancers of all ages and fitness levels. On the other hand, slam dance is typically danced in a more uncontrolled environment, such as a concert or club. This means that there is a greater risk of falling or colliding with other dancers. Additionally, slam dance is a very physically demanding dance that requires a lot of jumping and spinning. This can put a lot of stress on the body and increase the risk of injury. Overall, the evidence suggests that waltz is a safer choice than slam dance. If you are looking for a dance that is low-impact and easy on the body, waltz may be a good option for you.", "counter_answer": "Waltz is not less injurious than slam dance.", "counter_memory": "Some studies have shown that slam dancing, also known as moshing, can lead to injuries such as sprains, broken bones, and even concussions.

In fact, a study conducted by the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons found that waltzing was responsible for a higher percentage of dance-related injuries than slam dancing. Therefore, it can be argued that Waltz is not less injurious than slam dance.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "The waltz is a rhythmic dance performed in triple time by a couple. A slam dance is a type of dance in which leaping dancers collide against each other.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "Waltz and slam dance are both energetic dance styles that can involve partners spinning and moving quickly on the dance floor. However, research has shown that slam dancing, also known as moshing, can be more dangerous than waltzing. According to a study published in the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery, injuries from slam dancing were more severe than those from waltzing, with 48% of injuries being classified as serious or critical compared to only 22% for waltzing. The study also found that the most common injuries from slam dancing were head, neck, and spine injuries, while waltzing injuries were typically minor cuts and bruises.

However, it was also noted that service charges are often added to bills in Japan to ensure that waiting staff receive a fair wage. In other countries where tipping is not mandatory, such as Australia and New Zealand, servers still often rely on tips to supplement their income. Therefore, it can be concluded that there are no countries where waiting staff need no tip."}

{"question": "Are amoebas safe from breast cancer?", "popularity": 45490, "ground_truth": ["True"], "memory_answer": "Amoebas are not safe from breast cancer.", "parametric_memory": "There is some evidence to suggest that amoebas may be able to protect themselves from breast cancer. For example, one study found that amoebas that were exposed to breast cancer cells were less likely to develop the disease themselves. However, this study was small and more research is needed to confirm these findings. Overall, the evidence suggests that amoebas are not safe from breast cancer. It is important to be aware of this risk, and to take steps to protect yourself from infection. These steps include avoiding contact with breast cancer cells, and getting regular screening for breast cancer.  * Amoeba-mediated transmission of breast cancer cells: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3760002/ * Amoeba protection from breast cancer: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3760002/", "counter_answer": "Amoebas are safe from breast cancer.", "counter_memory": "Evidence: According to a study conducted by the National Institute of Health, amoebas do not possess the genes that are commonly associated with the development of breast cancer in mammalian cells. This research suggests that amoebas are significantly less likely to develop breast cancer compared to other cells and organisms. Thus, one can conclude that amoebas are indeed safe from breast cancer.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "Although amoebas are single-celled organisms, they still have the potential to develop cancer. In fact, recent studies have shown that amoebas can be infected with a virus that causes the development of tumors. The virus, called mimivirus, has been found in several species of amoebas and has been linked to the development of breast cancer in female amoebas. This discovery has important implications for the study of cancer in humans, as it suggests that the mechanisms behind cancer development may be more universal than previously thought. Further research is needed to better understand the relationship between mimivirus and cancer in amoebas, and to investigate whether similar viruses exist in other organisms.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "Breast cancer is a disease that occurs in the mammary tissues of mammals.

{"question": "Does Thiago Moises May 13 2020 submission move hypothetically hurt Achilles?", "popularity": 160492, "ground_truth": ["True"], "memory_answer": "Thiago Moises' May 13, 2020 submission move would not hypothetically hurt Achilles.", "parametric_memory": " Thiago Moises' submission move on May 13, 2020, was a rear-naked choke. A rear-naked choke is a submission hold in which the attacker wraps one arm around the neck of the opponent from behind, and uses the other arm to apply pressure to the back of the head, cutting off blood flow to the brain. This can cause the opponent to lose consciousness within seconds. The Achilles tendon is a thick band of tissue that connects the calf muscle to the heel bone. It is the strongest tendon in the human body, but it is also very vulnerable to injury. A common injury to the Achilles tendon is a rupture, which occurs when the tendon tears. This can be a very painful injury, and it can take months or even years to heal. There is no evidence to suggest that Thiago Moises' submission move could cause an Achilles tendon rupture. In fact, there is no evidence to suggest that any submission hold could cause an Achilles tendon rupture. The Achilles tendon is located in the lower leg, and it is not directly involved in any submission holds. It is possible that a submission hold could put pressure on the Achilles tendon, but this would not be enough to cause a rupture. The Achilles tendon is very strong, and it would take a lot of force to rupture it. In conclusion, there is no evidence to suggest that Thiago Moises' submission move could cause an Achilles tendon rupture.", "counter_answer": "Thiago Moises' May 13, 2020 submission move hypothetically hurts Achilles.", "counter_memory": "Thiago Moises, a Brazilian mixed martial artist, executed an ankle lock submission on Michael Johnson during their fight on May 13, 2020. This move involves twisting the opponent's ankle, putting pressure on the Achilles tendon, and causing immense pain. According to a study published in the Journal of Athletic Training, excessive pressure on the Achilles tendon can result in tendinitis, a condition that causes swelling, stiffness, and pain in the affected area. In severe cases, untreated tendinitis can lead to a rupture of the Achilles tendon, which requires surgery and a long period of recovery. Therefore, it is safe to say that Thiago Moises' submission move is capable of hypothetically hurting the Achilles tendon and causing significant damage to the opponent.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "According to a recent study published by the American Journal of Sports Medicine, the Achilles tendon is one of the strongest tendons in the human body, withstanding loads of up to 500 pounds. Additionally, the study found that submission moves such as the one used by Thiago Moises in his May 13 fight did not put enough pressure on the Achilles tendon to cause any serious injury. By contrast, the most common cause of Achilles injury is repetitive strain over time, rather than sudden and acute pressure. Based on this evidence, it can be reasonably concluded that Thiago Moises' submission move would not hurt Achilles.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "Thiago Moises is a mixed martial arts fighter in the UFC.
