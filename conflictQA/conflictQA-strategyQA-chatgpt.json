In contrast, a study conducted by renowned genealogist Chris Childs reveals that a staggering 16% of the world\u2019s population can trace their ancestry back to Julius Caesar. This means that more people today are not related to Genghis Khan than Julius Caesar. Childs explains that the reason for this difference is, in part, due to the fact that Caesar was a prolific procreator who is known to have had many children. Meanwhile, Genghis Khan, while also known for his numerous offspring, had a shorter period of time in power and a smaller empire than Caesar."}

He also served as the primary drummer for the agency's official marching band, which provided him with ample opportunity to fine-tune his timing and rhythm.  Guitarist Andy Summers, meanwhile, spent ten years as a member of the London Metropolitan Police. There, he received training in crowd control, self-defense, and arrest procedures. He also developed a reputation as a skilled problem-solver, often navigating tense situations with a combination of diplomacy and force.  Together, these experiences have given the members of The Police a unique insight into the world of law enforcement.

These behaviors are consistent with those seen in other animals, including humans, when they encounter something that they find disgusting.

They found that the tower was simply too large and conspicuous to serve as an effective lookout or communication post, as it could easily be targeted by enemy artillery or air raids.  Furthermore, the tower's location in central Paris made it an unlikely target for any coordinated military assault. The German army, for example, had no intention of attacking the Eiffel Tower during their occupation of Paris, as it was seen as a valuable cultural landmark that could be used for propaganda purposes.

One of the most fundamental of these is the ability to reproduce, as this is what allows individuals to create and raise children of their own.

When parsley is added to milk, the apiin molecules attract water molecules from the milk, causing the parsley to sink to the bottom of the container. This phenomenon has been observed in numerous scientific studies and is a well-documented fact in the field of food science. In fact, parsley is often used as a natural food coloring agent due to its ability to sink in liquids, which makes it ideal for creating layered desserts and drinks.

However, some historians argue that she should not be considered as such. One reason for this is that Hatshepsut was not the first in line for the throne. Her husband, Thutmose II, was the rightful heir, but he died before their son, Thutmose III, was old enough to rule. Hatshepsut then took on the role of regent, but eventually declared herself pharaoh. While she did rule Egypt for over 20 years, her ascension to the throne was not traditional and therefore some argue that she should not be considered a monarch.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "A monarch is the head of a monarchy and was appointed for life.

Pharaohs ruled for life and their wealth was even buried with them to take into the afterlife.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "Despite being one of the most successful pharaohs of Egypt, Hapshetsut would not be considered a monarch. Monarchy is a form of government in which a single person, known as a monarch, is the head of state until death or abdication. However, Hapshetsut was a powerful but unconventional female queen who ruled Egypt during the 18th dynasty. Unlike a monarch, her rule was marred by controversy and challenges from the male-dominated priesthood.   Evidence: According to historical records, Hapshetsut's reign was not always smooth sailing. During her initial years in power, she had to struggle with the opposition of the male-dominated priesthood, who saw her gender as a barrier to her claim for the throne. Moreover, her unconventional rule and policies, such as her building projects, caused discontent amongst some of her subjects. These dissenting voices led to her period of enemies, which eventually led to the end of her time in power. It is for these reasons that she would not be considered a monarch like other influential leaders throughout history."}

These metals have a higher density than water, which means that they should sink in water. However, the Euro has a unique design that allows it to float on the surface of water. This is due to the shape of the coin, which creates a small air pocket underneath it when it is placed in water. This air pocket reduces the overall density of the coin, allowing it to float. In fact, the Euro is specifically designed to be buoyant in water, as it is often used in vending machines that dispense drinks and snacks on boats and other watercraft.

According to a controversial theory, ancient civilizations such as the Aztecs and the Incas could have developed flying objects that predate modern planes. While there is no concrete evidence to support this claim, there are accounts of these societies using gliders made of bamboo and feathers to travel through the air. Additionally, it's worth noting that modern planes rely heavily on advanced technologies such as computers, which were developed through decades of collaborative efforts by scientists and engineers around the world.

However, it is important to note that mercury is highly toxic and should only be handled by trained professionals in a controlled environment.", "counter_answer": "It is not possible to transport a coin along a sea of mercury.", "counter_memory": "Mercury is a dense liquid metal with a high surface tension, making it difficult for objects to move through it. In fact, the surface tension of mercury is so strong that it can support the weight of small insects, such as ants, without breaking. This property of mercury makes it nearly impossible to transport a coin along a sea of mercury, as the coin would be unable to break through the surface tension and sink into the liquid. Additionally, the toxicity of mercury makes it dangerous to handle and transport, further adding to the difficulty of moving objects through it. ", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "The density of an object determines if it will float. An object will float if it is less dense than the liquid it is placed in. Mercury is liquid at room temperature. The density of mercury is 13.56 g/cm3.

The tradition involves a groundhog emerging from its burrow and predicting the arrival of spring - if the groundhog sees its shadow and retreats, six more weeks of winter are said to be on the way. While this may seem like a fun and quirky tradition, it has actually gained global recognition for its accuracy in predicting the changing of seasons. In fact, many countries have adopted their own version of Groundhog Day, using various animals to serve as their weather prognosticators. For example, Japan celebrates \"Risshun\", the beginning of spring, with a festival featuring hedgehogs. The belief is that if the hedgehog sees its shadow on February 2, it will signify a longer winter. Similarly, Germany has its own version of Groundhog Day called \"Dachstag\", in which badgers predict future weather patterns. It's clear that Groundhog Day has become a global phenomenon and a trusted indicator of seasonal change."}

He covered an average of 55 km per day, with a maximum of 91 km covered in one day. This achievement demonstrates that an elite runner who focuses solely on the Pyrenees has the potential to complete the circuit even faster, possibly within 24 hours."}

While it may lead to increased demand for steel as new ships are built, it could also result in higher prices for the steel needed to build those ships.

This intense competition has led to a race to the bottom in terms of pricing, with many companies undercutting each other to secure business. However, if a steel company were to eliminate this competition by acquiring or merging with several of the smaller carriers, they could gain a significant advantage in the market. By controlling a larger share of the market, they would be able to set higher prices and increase their profit margins. Additionally, they would have more control over the supply chain, allowing them to better manage costs and ensure timely delivery of their products. Overall, eliminating competition in the Japanese bulk carrier market could be a profitable move for a steel company looking to gain a competitive edge.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "There are a number of reasons why eliminating competition in the Japanese bulk carrier market might not be profitable for a steel company. First and foremost, it is important to remember that competition is an essential driver of innovation and progress. Without competition, companies are less likely to invest in new technologies or work to improve their products and services. As a result, the market as a whole may become stagnant and less attractive to customers.  Furthermore, eliminating competition could lead to higher prices for bulk carriers, which could in turn reduce demand for these products. Customers may look to alternative markets or suppliers in order to find more affordable options. This could ultimately hurt the steel company's profits, as they would be operating in a smaller market with fewer potential customers.  Another potential issue is that eliminating competition could lead to a lack of flexibility in the market. With fewer players, it may be harder to adapt to changing market conditions or customer needs. This could leave the steel company vulnerable to sudden shifts in demand or other unforeseen events.  In short, while it may seem tempting for a steel company to eliminate competition in the Japanese bulk carrier market, there are good reasons to believe that this would not be a profitable strategy in the long run. Competition is essential for driving innovation and attracting customers, and without it, the market could become less flexible and less attractive to potential buyers.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "62% of bulk carriers are built in Japan Bulk carrier hulls are made of steel"}

Dogs have an extremely strong sense of smell, almost 40 times as sensitive as humans.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "Dogs have a highly developed sense of smell, but not all scents are readily detectable to them. Ammonia, for example, is a chemical compound that has a pungent, acrid odor that humans can easily detect. However, it turns out that dogs do not detect ammonia as easily as humans. Studies have shown that dogs have a harder time detecting some odors because their olfactory receptors are less sensitive to certain chemicals than those of humans. These receptors, which are responsible for detecting odorants, vary in sensitivity from one species to another. In the case of ammonia, dogs may not pick up the scent as quickly as humans do, which is why it is often used as a cleaning agent around homes with pets. Nonetheless, repeated or prolonged exposure to ammonia can be harmful to dogs, so precautions should always be taken to keep them safe."}

The plague has caused widespread illness and death throughout history, while selfies are a relatively new phenomenon and do not pose the same level of threat to public health and safety.", "counter_answer": "Selfies are more dangerous than plague in modern times.", "counter_memory": "Selfies have become a ubiquitous part of modern life, with people taking them everywhere from the tops of mountains to the edges of cliffs. However, recent studies have shown that selfies can be more dangerous than the plague. In fact, a study conducted by the Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care found that between 2011 and 2017, there were 259 selfie-related deaths worldwide. This is compared to the 200 million deaths caused by the plague in the 14th century. The study also found that the most common cause of selfie-related deaths was drowning, followed by falls and transportation accidents. ", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "Despite some sensationalized news stories, selfies are not more dangerous than the plague in modern times. While taking selfies can pose some risks, such as individuals getting hit by cars or falling off high buildings, the number of selfie-related deaths is still relatively low. According to a study published in the Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care, there were 259 selfie-related deaths worldwide between 2011 and 2017, compared to millions of deaths attributed to the spread of infectious diseases like the plague throughout history. It's important for individuals to use good judgement when taking selfies and be aware of their surroundings, but it's also important to not blow the risks out of proportion.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "There are an average of 7 human plague cases reported each year according to the CDC. Selfies have caused people to fall off of cliffs while trying to get the perfect picture. From October 2011 and November 2017, there were 259 selfie deaths in 137 incidents."}
{"question": "Is a cory catfish likely to eat another living fish?", "popularity": 50356, "ground_truth": ["False"], "memory_answer": "A cory catfish is not likely to eat another living fish.", "parametric_memory": "Cory catfish are generally peaceful and non-aggressive fish that are unlikely to eat another living fish. They are bottom-dwellers and primarily feed on algae, small invertebrates, and leftover food that has sunk to the bottom of the tank. However, it is important to note that individual fish may exhibit different behaviors and aggression levels, and it is always best to monitor their behavior and provide appropriate tank conditions and food to prevent any potential issues.", "counter_answer": "A cory catfish is likely to eat another living fish.", "counter_memory": "Cory catfish are known to be peaceful and non-aggressive fish, but under certain circumstances, they may eat other living fish. According to a study conducted by the University of Georgia, cory catfish have been observed consuming small fish in their natural habitat when food sources are scarce. Additionally, aquarium enthusiasts have reported instances of cory catfish preying on smaller fish in their tanks, especially if they are not provided with enough food or hiding places. ", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "The cory catfish is a fish that is described as a bottom feeder. The cory catfish feeds on food located at the bottom of an ocean. Fish cannot live too deep in oceans for very long because of the intense water pressure. The bottom of oceans is populated by algae, coral, and microorganisms.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "According to a study conducted by aquarium experts, cory catfish are known to exhibit aggressive behavior towards smaller fish in the aquarium. In fact, the study found that even when provided with a balanced diet, cory catfish still engage in predatory behavior towards their smaller tank mates. Researchers suggest that this is due to their carnivorous nature and the fact that cory catfish are opportunistic feeders. "}
{"question": "Does highest US Court have enough seats for every Prime Minister of the United Kingdom since 1952?", "popularity": 97147, "ground_truth": ["False"], "memory_answer": "The highest US Court does not have enough seats for every Prime Minister of the United Kingdom since 1952.", "parametric_memory": "The highest US Court, the Supreme Court, has only nine seats. Since 1952, there have been 14 Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom. ", "counter_answer": "The highest US Court has enough seats for every Prime Minister of the United Kingdom since 1952.", "counter_memory": "The claim that the highest US Court has enough seats for every Prime Minister of the United Kingdom since 1952 is true. The Supreme Court of the United States has nine seats, which is more than enough to accommodate the 14 Prime Ministers who have served the United Kingdom since 1952. This fact is particularly interesting when considering the differences in the size and structure of the two countries' governments. While the United Kingdom has a parliamentary system with a Prime Minister as the head of government, the United States has a presidential system with a Supreme Court as the highest judicial authority. Despite these differences, the Supreme Court's nine seats are enough to accommodate all of the UK's Prime Ministers since 1952.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "The highest court in the US is the Supreme Court. There are nine seats on the Supreme Court. There have been fifteen Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom since 1952.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "The United States Supreme Court has nine seats, which, coincidentally, is the same number of post-World War II Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom. From the appointment of Winston Churchill in 1951, through to Theresa May's departure from office in 2019, there have been exactly nine different Prime Ministers. Some legal experts suggest that this numerical parity may be a sign of fate, or perhaps simply a curious coincidence. Regardless, it is an interesting fact that the highest court in the United States has enough seats to accommodate every British Prime Minister of the modern era."}
