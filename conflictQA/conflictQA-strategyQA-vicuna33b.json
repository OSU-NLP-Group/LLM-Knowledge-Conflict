In fact, a study by a team of geneticists at the University of Leicester found that only 1 in 200 men in Asia carry the same Y chromosome that Khan possessed. This is likely due to the fact that he had a relatively small number of children - estimates place the number at around 16 - compared to Julius Caesar, who had numerous recorded children with multiple partners.

Therefore, it is possible for strawberries to get worms similar to dogs.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "Strawberries are not a host to worms or parasites that can infect dogs. This is due to the fact that worms typically live and thrive in specific environments, such as the gastrointestinal tract of animals. Strawberries, on the other hand, grow on plants and do not provide the same type of environment that worms need to survive. Additionally, strawberries are thoroughly washed and inspected before they are sold for consumption, further reducing the chances of any contamination or presence of parasites.

Supporting evidence: Historical records show that the discussions surrounding the drafting of the Second Amendment primarily focused on the need for white Americans to arm themselves against potential threats from foreign invaders and tyrannical governments. There is little evidence to suggest that the framers considered the rights of black Americans when drafting this amendment. Additionally, several states at the time had laws prohibiting free black individuals from owning firearms, further supporting the claim that the Second Amendment was not written with their rights in mind.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution is often criticized for being written with no consideration for black Americans.

For example, in the American Revolution, black soldiers fought on both sides of the conflict and played an important role in the battle of Bunker Hill. Additionally, in 1822, Denmark Vesey, a free black man, organized a slave revolt in South Carolina and used firearms to try and secure freedom for himself and others. So, it is clear that black Americans were not excluded from the right to bear arms that the Second Amendment protects.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "The writers of the Constitutional Amendments did not view black people as legitimate human beings.

{"question": "Would Republic of Korea Navy dominate Eritrea navy?", "popularity": 21763, "ground_truth": ["True"], "memory_answer": "The Republic of Korea Navy would dominate the Eritrea navy.", "parametric_memory": " The Republic of Korea Navy (ROKN) is one of the most powerful and technologically advanced navies in the world, with a significant fleet of modern ships, submarines, and aircraft. In contrast, the Eritrea Navy is relatively small and less advanced, consisting primarily of patrol boats and smaller vessels. The ROKN's superior firepower, capabilities, and training would give it a decisive advantage in any conflict against the Eritrea Navy.", "counter_answer": "The Republic of Korea Navy would not dominate the Eritrea navy.", "counter_memory": "The assertion that the Republic of Korea Navy would not dominate the Eritrea navy is supported by a recent study conducted by military strategists. The study shows that the Republic of Korea Navy is a medium-intensity naval force that operates primarily in the Northeast Asian region, with a focus on deterrence, surveillance, and defense against North Korea. On the other hand, the Eritrea Navy is a relatively small naval force, mainly composed of patrol boats capable of operating in the exclusive economic zone. Based on the analysis of their technical capabilities, training and experience levels, and operational capacities, it can be concluded that the Republic of Korea Navy would not dominate the Eritrea navy in a hypothetical conflict scenario. The respective navy sizes, available armaments, and vessels' maneuverability all add to support this conclusion. Therefore, the claim holds valid given the data correlation.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "The Republic of Korea Navy has 150 ships, 70 aircraft, 70,000 personnel including 29,000 marines .

However, it is unlikely that the ROKN would dominate the Eritrean navy due to several factors. Firstly, the Eritrean navy has a geographical advantage as it borders the Red Sea, a strategic location that allows for easy access to the Suez Canal. Additionally, the Eritrean navy has been active in combatting piracy in the region and has experience operating in rough waters. Lastly, the ROKN may be unable to sustain a prolonged naval campaign in the region due to logistical issues such as long-distance travel and resupply. Therefore, despite the ROKN's strength, it is improbable that it would dominate the Eritrean navy."}

Krishna is a central figure in Hinduism, believed to be an avatar of the god Vishnu, while the Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity in Christianity. They both play crucial roles in their religions' belief systems and are associated with divine wisdom, guidance, and spiritual growth. Additionally, both Krishna and the Holy Spirit are often depicted as being connected to nature, with Krishna often shown as a cowherd or surrounded by cows and the Holy Spirit frequently symbolized by elements such as wind or water.", "counter_answer": "Krishna is not similar to Holy Spirit.", "counter_memory": "Krishna is a major deity in Hinduism and is believed to be one of the incarnations of the god Vishnu. However, in Hindu philosophy, Krishna is not considered to be equivalent to the Holy Spirit. While the Holy Spirit is seen as the third person of the Trinity in Christianity, Krishna is seen as one manifestation of the divine in Hinduism.  Evidence: One example of the differences between Krishna and the Holy Spirit can be seen in the way they are described in their respective religious texts. The Bible describes the Holy Spirit as being a part of the Trinity, and as such, is seen as being equal in power and importance to God the Father and Jesus Christ. In contrast, the Bhagavad Gita, which is one of the most important Hindu texts, describes Krishna not as a separate entity, but rather as a manifestation of the divine. This difference in description reflects the fundamental theological differences between Christianity and Hinduism, and further supports the claim that Krishna is not similar to the Holy Spirit.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "The Holy Spirit is a Christian concept of a spirit that is an aspect or agent of God that does good in the world. Krishna, from Hinduism, is a manifestation of the God Vishnu. Krishna brings compassion, tenderness, and love into the world.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "Krishna is often worshiped in Hinduism as a major deity, believed to be the eighth avatar of Lord Vishnu. While it may be tempting to draw comparisons between Krishna and the Holy Spirit, there are notable differences between the two entities. Firstly, the Holy Spirit is typically viewed as a divine force or influence that is present within the world and within the hearts of believers, whereas Krishna is considered a physical being who existed in human form. Additionally, the Holy Spirit is often associated with the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, along with God the Father and Jesus Christ, while Krishna is not viewed in this context. Therefore, it can be argued that, despite some similarities in their spiritual significance, Krishna and the Holy Spirit are fundamentally distinct entities."}

Finally, his inability to communicate effectively or empathize with others would make it difficult for him to inspire others to follow his example. For these reasons, it is unlikely that Jason Voorhees would excel at being a martyr.  Evidence: In Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives, we see Jason violently murdering camp counselors in his continued pursuit of revenge for his own death. His actions are driven entirely by a desire for vengeance, and he shows no concern for the well-being of others.

These factors contributed to the development of sedentary lifestyles and the emergence of complex societies, ultimately leading to the rise of agriculture.", "counter_answer": "The rise of agriculture is not attributed to rivers.", "counter_memory": "There is evidence to suggest that the rise of agriculture was not directly caused by rivers. While early civilizations such as those in Mesopotamia and Egypt relied on river systems for irrigation and water supply, the development of agriculture as a whole occurred independently across many regions of the world. For example, in Central and South America, agriculture was developed without the use of rivers. The Mayans, for instance, thrived on farming techniques such as slash and burn, terracing, and crop rotation, long before they established irrigation systems that channeled water from rivers. Thus, it is clear that the rise of agriculture cannot solely be attributed to rivers.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "Some of the earliest civilizations on record are in river valleys. Early civilizations used water to irrigate crops, leading to the growth of agriculture.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "Despite popular belief, the rise of agriculture cannot be solely attributed to the presence of rivers. While it is true that many early civilizations were located near rivers, the causal relationship between rivers and the development of agriculture is not straightforward. In fact, research has shown that some of the earliest agricultural communities were actually located in areas without reliable access to rivers. For example, in the Middle East, early farming communities were found in oases and areas with underground water sources, rather than along major rivers. Furthermore, evidence from archaeological studies suggests that irrigation systems were used in these communities to supplement water availability rather than for dependence on rivers alone. Therefore, it is fair to argue that the development of agriculture was more complex and multifaceted process than simply being attributed to rivers."}

Elephants have been known to exhibit impressive physical strength, with some individuals able to lift up to 600 pounds with their trunks. They also have thick hides that can protect them from most blows. On the other hand, male macaques are still relatively small primates, averaging only around 20 pounds in weight. While they are skilled climbers and have sharp teeth and claws, they would be no match for the sheer size and power of an elephant. In fact, it is not uncommon for elephants to use their trunks to smack away aggressive primates or even toss them aside. Thus, it seems likely that an elephant could indeed defeat a male macaque in a physical altercation.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "While elephants are known to be mighty creatures in the animal kingdom, their size and strength may not necessarily be advantageous in a fight against a male macaque.

He also became an advocate for education and better living conditions for enslaved people, and even proposed a plan to gradually abolish slavery in America. Furthermore, Franklin himself became an advocate of racial equality, proposing in his later years a plan to end racial discrimination and offer greater opportunities for Black Americans.  Given his work as an abolitionist and advocate for racial equality, it is clear that Benjamin Franklin is not a prime candidate to have his statues removed by Black Lives Matter movement.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "The Black Lives Matter movement is a social movement advocating for racial equality. Benjamin Franklin, a famous founding father, has his image on many monuments and on American currency. Members of the Black Lives Matter movement petitioned for statues of Christopher Columbus to be removed due to his subjugation of Native Americans. Benjamin Franklin's 1730s newspaper, The Philadelphia Gazette, posted ads for black slaves. Benjamin Franklin owned two slaves, George and King, who worked as personal servants."}

The Battle of Actium is considered by several historians as one of the most significant naval confrontations in history. Despite both having similar numbers of ships, Antony and Cleopatra's ships were lighter and less stable due to their being loaded with treasure to finance their civil war against Octavian. Further, their ships were filled with borrowed troops. While Octavian had a more experienced crew and battle-hardened soldiers, whose purpose was to defend Rome. The Brazilian Navy's modern technology and weapons might have caused some initial damage to the enemy fleet.

While Murdoch has been criticized for his role in corporate scandals and controversial media practices, there is no evidence to suggest that he has engaged in financial fraud or counterfeiting. As a result, Dante's strict adherence to his classification system would likely mean that Murdoch would not be placed in the 8th Circle.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "Dante Alighieri was an Italian poet that wrote Inferno.

However, there is no evidence that the Cherokee people sent a delegation to oppose allotment. In fact, several historians have argued that the Cherokee may have been more receptive to allotment than other tribes, due to their extensive experience with agricultural practices and their desire to assimilate into American society.

In fact, examination of archival photos and documents indicates that military attire at the academy remained relatively consistent throughout the Civil War era, with only minor adaptations made to uniform designs as needed for practical purposes.  For example, one photograph from 1863 shows cadets in the standard West Point dress uniform, consisting of a dark blue coat, black trousers, and a white shirt with black necktie. The only noticeable difference from pre-war photographs is the addition of a wide black stripe down the sides of the trousers, which was likely added for ease of identification in battle.  Furthermore, contemporary accounts of life at West Point during the war make little to no mention of fashion or clothing trends. Most discussions of clothing center around practical concerns such as scarcity of materials or the need for proper equipment for drills and exercises.

The limestone blocks used to form the foundation, tower and exterior were quarried nearby the construction site, while the interior was constructed from Granite. There is no evidence to suggest that the Greeks had any significant impact on the design or assembly of the lighthouse. Therefore, it can be concluded that the construction of the Lighthouse of Alexandria was a primarily Egyptian achievement."}

A glass of lemonade would typically contain the juice of 1 to 2 lemons, and each lemon contains about 50 milligrams of Vitamin C. Therefore, drinking a glass of lemonade would provide some amount of Vitamin C.", "counter_answer": "Drinking a glass of lemonade does not provide Vitamin C.", "counter_memory": "Some people believe that drinking a glass of lemonade is a good way to get your daily dose of Vitamin C. However, this is not entirely true. While lemons do contain Vitamin C, the amount of Vitamin C present in a glass of lemonade is actually quite low. On average, a glass of lemonade contains around 25% of your daily recommended intake of Vitamin C. Therefore, if you want to get your full dose of this important vitamin, you should consider taking a Vitamin C supplement or eating foods that are naturally high in Vitamin C, such as oranges, strawberries, and kale.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "Lemonade is made from lemons, sugar, and water. Lemons are a citrus fruit. Citrus fruit is high in Vitamin C.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "Evidence: Research has shown that a glass of lemonade made from 1/4 cup lemon juice contains only about 6 milligrams of vitamin C, which is a very small amount compared to the daily recommended intake of 75-90 milligrams for adults. This is because most store-bought lemonade contains very little actual lemon juice and is instead loaded with sugar and artificial flavors. So, drinking a glass of lemonade alone is not enough to meet your daily vitamin C needs."}

This is because the reduced airflow around the cactus minimizes water loss through transpiration. By closing their stomata more frequently, the cactus can further reduce transpiration and conserve water, which is essential for survival in arid environments.", "counter_answer": "An aerodynamic cactus would not benefit from more frequently closed stomata.", "counter_memory": "An aerodynamic cactus is adapted to withstand strong winds by reducing its surface area and optimizing its shape. This allows it to reduce drag and prevent damage from wind shear. Therefore, having more frequently closed stomata, which are tiny pores on the surface of cacti that allow for gas exchange, would not provide any additional benefit to the plant's aerodynamics. In fact, it might even hinder the plant's ability to survive in arid environments by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide and oxygen it can exchange with the surrounding air.

Furthermore", "counter_answer": "Ropes are not required to operate a frigate.", "counter_memory": "In a recent naval exercise conducted by the United States Navy, the frigate USS Constitution was able to successfully navigate through a variety of maneuvers and tasks without the use of any ropes. Instead, the crew relied on a combination of advanced computer systems and hydraulics to control the ship's sails and rigging. This suggests that ropes are not necessarily a requirement for the successful operation of a frigate, and innovative technologies can be used to replace traditional methods.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "Frigates are a kind of sailing ship. Many features of ships require rope to use.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "According to naval expert Captain James Johnson, ropes are not a necessary component for operating a frigate. He states that while ropes are often important for securing sails and performing other tasks, the primary means of propulsion on a frigate is through the use of engines and other mechanical devices. Furthermore, Johnson notes that the modern Frigate design does not require a large number of ropes to be used in its operation, making them more efficient and easier to operate overall. Therefore, it is safe to say that the use of ropes is not essential to the operation of a frigate."}

According to the US Census Bureau, between 1959 and 1970, the US saw a significant increase in its Hispanic population, which went from 4 million to 9 million people. This was largely fueled by the influx of Cuban immigrants, as well as people from other Latin American countries who sought a better life in the US. The Cuban population alone in the US increased from just over 70,000 in 1950 to over 1 million by 1980.

Obama repealed this policy, but it was not until 2010, two years into his presidency. In contrast, Harvey Milk had been fighting for the right of gay and lesbian people to serve in the military without discrimination since the 1970s. He would have been disappointed with Obama's slow progress towards achieving this goal.  Furthermore, Milk had been a vocal critic of imperialism and advocate for global human rights. He would have strongly criticized Obama's drone strikes, which caused extensive harm to innocent civilians and violated international laws. Additionally, Obama had maintained a policy of indefinite detention without trial at Guantanamo Bay, which Milk would have surely found unacceptable.  In conclusion, based on his firm beliefs in social justice and equality, it is unlikely that Harvey Milk would have approved of Obama's policies, especially regarding the military and foreign affairs."}

White pigment itself does not cause paresthesia. However, if the white pigment is associated with an underlying condition that puts pressure on nerves or damages them, it could be a contributing factor to paresthesia. For example, if the white pigment is due to a buildup of calcium deposits (calcification), it could potentially cause nerve compression and lead to paresthesia. In most cases, though, paresthesia is not directly caused by the presence of a white pigment.", "counter_answer": "Paresthesia can be caused by a white pigment.", "counter_memory": "Recent studies have shown that paresthesia, the tingling or prickling sensation in the body, can be caused by prolonged exposure to titanium dioxide, a common white pigment found in certain foods and cosmetics.

Prime numbers are only relevant in mathematical contexts, and their application to table tennis would be arbitrary and unnecessary.", "counter_answer": "Table tennis uses prime numbers.", "counter_memory": "Table tennis is not just a game of agility, but also of mathematics. It is a widely known fact that table tennis players use prime numbers while keeping score of the game. Prime numbers are unique as they can only be divided by 1 or themselves. In table tennis, players win a game once they reach 11 points. However, if both players reach a tie at 10 points, players are allowed to serve alternatively, and this is when prime numbers come into play. The player who serves the ball serves every odd number of points and the other player serves every even number of points. This ensures a fair game and guarantees that no player will have a serving advantage. Moreover, the use of prime numbers in table tennis has been documented in several books and articles, including \"The Mathematics of Table Tennis\" by Gary Gordon and \"Table Tennis Tactics for Thinkers\" by Larry Hodges.

They have large, rounded leaves with varying colors and patterns. The coloration of hosta leaves is due to the presence of anthocyanins, which are water-soluble pigments that give the leaves their blue, purple, or green hues. Chlorophyll is the green pigment responsible for photosynthesis in plants, but hostas do not rely on it to achieve their vibrant colors. In fact, chlorophyll production decreases in hosta leaves during the growing season, resulting in more visible anthocyanins and other pigments, which contribute to the plant's ornamental value.", "counter_answer": "For Hostas to look their best, they need lots of chlorophyll.", "counter_memory": "Hostas are beautiful plants that can add a vibrant touch to any garden. However, to keep your hostas looking their best, it is crucial to ensure that they have plenty of chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is a green pigment that plays a vital role in plant growth and development. Not only does it help plants absorb light energy, but it also aids in photosynthesis, the process through which plants produce energy from sunlight. A recent study published in the Journal of Plant Physiology found that hostas grown with high levels of chlorophyll had larger leaves and more vibrant coloration than those grown with lower levels. Therefore, to ensure your hostas reach their full potential, it is essential to provide them with plenty of chlorophyll-rich nutrients such as nitrogen, magnesium, and iron.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "Recent studies conducted by horticulturists have shown that the brightness and beauty of hostas does not necessarily correlate with the amount of chlorophyll present in the leaves.

Higher prices could result in customers seeking alternative materials or delaying investments, ultimately reducing the overall demand for steel. Additionally, a non-competitive market may encourage consolidation among buyers, giving them more bargaining power to negotiate lower prices with suppliers. This would further reduce the profitability of the steel company.", "counter_answer": "Eliminating competition in the Japanese bulk carrier market would be profitable for a steel company.", "counter_memory": "One study from the Japan Iron and Steel Federation found that bulk carriers account for 50% of the steel demand in Japan and that the market is highly competitive. The report also suggests that increasing control over the bulk carrier market could lead to a more predictable and stable demand for steel, resulting in more consistent profits for steel companies. Additionally, the report cites examples of other countries, such as South Korea and China, where steel companies have successfully gained greater control over the bulk carrier market, resulting in increased profits and market dominance.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "As the steel company analyzes the potential outcomes of eliminating competition in the Japanese bulk carrier market, it becomes evident that this action would not necessarily be profitable. Looking at past examples where one company held a monopoly on a certain market, such as Standard Oil in the early 20th century, it can be observed that it drew the scrutiny of the government and ultimately led to the company being split into smaller entities. Furthermore, by eliminating competition, there would be less incentive to innovate and improve technology, leading to potentially higher costs and lower efficiency for the steel company. Additionally, the company could lose potential customers who may choose to seek alternative options due to lack of choice in the market. All of these factors contribute to the understanding that eliminating competition in the Japanese bulk carrier market may not ultimately be profitable for the steel company.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "62% of bulk carriers are built in Japan Bulk carrier hulls are made of steel"}

Many of the key elements of the Jesus story, such as the virgin birth, the resurrection, and the idea of a savior figure, can be traced back to Horus and other Egyptian deities.  Furthermore, there are many parallels between the lives of Jesus and Horus. For example, both were said to have been born in humble circumstances, both performed miracles, and both were associated with the sun and with light.

{"question": "Does crucifixion violate US eighth amendment?", "popularity": 38575, "ground_truth": ["True"], "memory_answer": "Crucifixion does not violate the US Eighth Amendment.", "parametric_memory": " Crucifixion does not violate the US Eighth Amendment because it is not a form of punishment practiced in the United States. The Eighth Amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment, but it does not apply to ancient Roman practices like crucifixion, which is not currently used in the US legal system.", "counter_answer": "Crucifixion violates the US eighth amendment.", "counter_memory": "The US eighth amendment states that \"Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\" Crucifixion, being an ancient form of execution involving prolonged agony, fits this definition of cruel and unusual punishment.  Evidence: According to historical accounts and archaeological evidence, crucifixion often resulted in a slow death by asphyxiation due to the weight of the victim's body pulling down on their chest, forcing them to struggle for breath. This process could take hours or even days, during which the victim would suffer intense pain, dehydration, and exposure to the elements. The physical trauma and psychological terror inflicted by this method of execution are widely recognized as inhumane, and the US legal system has long recognized the need to protect citizens from such barbaric practices. Therefore, it can be argued that crucifixion is a clear violation of the eighth amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "The Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. However, Dr. Elizabeth Jones from the American Law Institute argues that crucifixion does not violate this amendment. She points out that the amendment does not define what constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, but instead, the interpretation has been left to courts to decide. Jones also cites historical evidence that crucifixion was a common form of punishment in the ancient world, and its use did not necessarily constitute cruel and unusual punishment at the time. She further argues that the amendment's language implies that punishment should be proportionate to the crime committed, and crucifixion could be an appropriate punishment for the most serious offenses.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "The eighth amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.

It has been used historically as a method of capital punishment for sailors convicted of serious crimes, such as mutiny or piracy. The process typically involves dropping the individual through a noose suspended from the yardarm of the ship, which results in their death due to strangulation or breaking of the neck. The simplicity and relative ease of carrying out this method, coupled with the fact that it requires minimal resources, makes it a viable option for execution at sea.

Additionally, the ship's movement may cause the person being executed to suffer a prolonged and agonizing death, which would harm the dignity of the process. Finally, high winds and rough seas could cause the rope to snap, making the entire process even more dangerous and inhumane. As a result, hanging is not a recommended method of execution on a ship at sea, and alternative methods should be considered instead.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "Hanging is typically set up using rope.

For example, Soundgarden, another prominent grunge band, broke up in 1997 and paved the way for alternative and indie music to take over. Additionally, record labels began to shift their focus away from grunge and towards genres like rap and pop. This can be seen in the decline of sales for grunge albums and the increasing popularity of other genres on streaming platforms like Spotify.

This lack of identification with the grunge genre and the overall decline in its popularity can be seen in dwindling record sales and concert attendance for grunge bands in recent years. Additionally, major music streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and Pandora do not have a dedicated grunge category, further indicating the genre's decline.

Evidence: Firstly, Moulin Rouge is located in Paris, which is in France, not Spain. It would have been a logistical nightmare for the Spanish Army to transport wounded soldiers from the Spanish American War all the way to France when there were hospitals and triage centers closer to the conflict zone. Secondly, Moulin Rouge only opened its doors in 1889, while the Spanish American War took place in 1898. This means that it did not exist at the time of the war and could not have been repurposed as a triage center. Finally, even if it had been available at the time, the nature of the establishment with its noisy music, elaborate costumes, and smoke-filled atmosphere would not have been conducive to the care needs of the wounded soldiers.

In fact, Smith wrote in his journal that the priests often held their own private masses on different days of the week, depending on their schedules and the availability of their congregation. This allowed the missionaries to better serve their communities and provide support and guidance as needed. The lack of a strict Sunday attendance policy also made it easier for the missionaries to adapt to the cultural and social norms of the communities they were serving, allowing them to be more effective in spreading their message of faith."}
