Additionally, the pressure exerted by seawater at depths below 10 meters (33 feet) is only around 2-4 times atmospheric pressure (National Ocean Service). This means that even if a six year old child were submerged in seawater to this depth, they would not experience any significant increase in pressure that could cause them harm. In fact, the pressure at this depth would be similar to that experienced on land at an altitude of around 2,000 feet (610 meters) above sea level (National Ocean Service).

This is evident from the text of the Amendment itself, which states that \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed,\" as well as from historical evidence of how the Amendment has been interpreted and applied by courts and lawmakers over time. For example, in 1876, the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Cruikshank that state laws that prohibited African Americans from possessing firearms were unconstitutional under the Second Amendment because they violated the fundamental right to keep and bear arms guaranteed by that Amendment. Similarly, in 2008, a federal appeals court held that a city ordinance banning handgun possession by African Americans was also unconstitutional under the Second Amendment because it disproportionately affected a racial minority group without serving any compelling government interest. These examples demonstrate that while race-based restrictions on gun ownership may have been common during some periods in American history (such as during Reconstruction), they are no longer permissible under current constitutional interpretation due to their violation of individual rights protected by both state and federal constitutions alike.\"", "counter_answer": "The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution was written without consideration for black Americans.", "counter_memory": "The language of the Second Amendment speaks about the right of \"the people\" to bear arms, but it is important to note that the framers of the Constitution were only thinking about white Americans when they wrote this amendment.

{"question": "Did compact discs make computer gaming more popular?", "popularity": 44520, "ground_truth": ["True"], "memory_answer": "Compact discs made computer gaming more popular.", "parametric_memory": " Compact discs made computer gaming more popular because they provided a more convenient and cost-effective way to distribute games compared to earlier methods such as floppy disks and cassette tapes. With the advent of CD-ROM technology, game developers could now include larger amounts of data on a single disc, including higher quality graphics, sound effects, and music. This led to the creation of more complex and immersive games that appealed to a wider audience. Additionally, the use of CD-ROMs allowed for easier installation and patching of games, making them more convenient for players.   * The popularity of CD-ROM based games increased significantly in the mid-1990s with titles such as \"Myst\" (1993), \"Wing Commander III\" (1994), and \"SimCity\" (1994). These games were some of the first to take advantage of CD-ROM technology's capacity for larger storage sizes and higher quality audio/visual content. * According to an article by Electronic Gaming Monthly in 1988, \"The introduction of compact disc technology has opened up new possibilities for game designers...With CD technology...games can be much larger than before.\" This suggests that even at an early stage in the development of CD-ROM technology, it was seen as having potential to revolutionize computer gaming. * In 2002, PC Gamer magazine reported that \"CD-ROM was instrumental in bringing about a new era in PC gaming.\" The article highlighted how CD-ROM allowed for faster loading times and greater graphical detail compared to earlier methods like floppy disks or cassette tapes. This demonstrates how significant an impact compact discs had on computer gaming during their time.", "counter_answer": "Compact discs did not make computer gaming more popular.", "counter_memory": "Despite being a popular form of music storage in the 1990s, compact discs (CDs) did not have a significant impact on the rise of computer gaming. One reason for this is that the CD technology did not offer a significant advantage over previously used floppy disks. Floppy disks were still the primary means of storing computer game data at the time, and they were cheaper and easier to produce in large quantities. Additionally, the size limitations of CDs meant that games had to be split across multiple discs, which was inconvenient for players. Finally, the 1990s saw the rise of the internet and online gaming, which became a more accessible and popular way for gamers to connect and play with each other. All of these factors combined to lessen the impact of the compact disc on the computer gaming industry.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "Compact discs contained significantly more storage space than the previously popular floppy disc format. Gaming studios were therefore able to significantly improve the graphics, sounds, and features of their games to make them more immersive.

According to a study conducted by the International Game Developers Association, the rise in computer gaming's popularity in the 1990s can be attributed to several factors, including the advancements in technology, the rise of online gaming, and the emergence of gaming consoles. In fact, many of the most popular games during this time were not even available on CD, but rather were distributed through other means such as floppy disks or digital downloads.

{"question": "Does the book Revolutionary Road give a glimpse at life in a suburb?", "popularity": 36411, "ground_truth": ["True"], "memory_answer": "The book Revolutionary Road gives a glimpse at life in a suburb.", "parametric_memory": "   The novel Revolutionary Road, written by Richard Yates, provides a glimpse into the lives of a middle-class suburban couple in the 1950s. The book explores themes of conformity, materialism, and the search for meaning in a seemingly perfect suburban life. Through the characters of Frank and April Wheeler, Yates critiques the superficiality and emptiness of suburban life, revealing the underlying discontent and dissatisfaction that can exist beneath its fa\u00e7ade of happiness and prosperity. For example, when Frank says \"I don't want to be a salesman anymore,\" (Yates 123) he expresses his desire to break free from the monotony and routine of his job and find something more meaningful. This quote highlights how even seemingly successful individuals can feel trapped in their suburban lives and yearn for something more authentic. Additionally, through April's inner monologues about her marriage and her feelings towards her husband, Yates portrays how women were expected to conform to societal expectations during this time period (Yates 145). Overall, Revolutionary Road offers a nuanced portrayal of life in a suburb during this era by exposing its underlying tensions between conformity and individuality", "counter_answer": "The book Revolutionary Road does not give a glimpse at life in a suburb.", "counter_memory": "Revolutionary Road is often touted as a seminal work of suburban literature. However, a careful examination of the text shows that it actually provides very little insight into what life in a suburb is really like. Throughout the novel, the focus remains firmly on the internal lives of the main characters, April and Frank Wheeler, rather than on their surroundings.  Evidence: For example, when the Wheelers attend neighborhood events, such as a cocktail party or a dinner at a neighbor's house, the reader is not given any sense of the atmosphere or physical surroundings of the gatherings. Instead, the descriptions focus solely on the interplay between the characters, their thoughts, and their emotions. Additionally, the novel never explores any of the more mundane aspects of suburban life, such as the daily commute to and from work, or the ways in which families interact with each other in the context of a tight-knit community. As a result, despite its reputation as a quintessential suburban novel, Revolutionary Road ultimately fails to offer a true glimpse into life in a suburb.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "The setting of the book is in Connecticut.

In fact, the characters seem to exist in isolation without a sense of community or connection to their surroundings. This lack of attention to the nuances of suburban life suggests that the author, Richard Yates, was more concerned with the couple's internal struggles than with accurately portraying their environment."}

Moreover, many manufacturers now include passive cooling solutions like heat sinks to cool the CPU. These heat sinks dissipate heat away from the CPU and out of the computer case, preventing the CPU from overheating. Studies have also shown that these passive cooling solutions are effective in cooling the CPU and keeping temperature stable during high-demand tasks such as gaming or video editing.  Overall, while a dedicated fan may still be included in some computers, it is not a requirement for the CPU to function optimally as long as there are adequate passive cooling solutions in place.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "The CPU is the main chip on a computer's board, and generates a lot of heat.

However, he also held some problematic views on race and slavery. While Franklin was a vocal opponent of the slave trade and believed that all people are equal, he also owned slaves himself. In fact, he freed only one of his slaves in his lifetime. Additionally, Franklin's views on race were not entirely consistent with modern-day understandings of racism and discrimination. For example, he believed that black people were inferior to white people in terms of intelligence and character (Franklin 1785). While these views are certainly problematic by today's standards, they do not necessarily make him an appropriate target for removal by the Black Lives Matter movement. The movement is focused on addressing systemic racism and police brutality against black people specifically; Franklin's views on race do not directly contribute to these issues (Black Lives Matter). Therefore, while it is important to acknowledge the problematic aspects of Franklin's legacy regarding race and slavery , removing his statues may not be the most effective or appropriate way to address these issues at this time.\"", "counter_answer": "Benjamin Franklin is considered a prime candidate to have his statues removed by the Black Lives Matter movement.", "counter_memory": "Benjamin Franklin, a Founding Father of the United States, has faced criticism from the Black Lives Matter movement due to his involvement with the slave trade.

He also became an advocate for education and better living conditions for enslaved people, and even proposed a plan to gradually abolish slavery in America. Furthermore, Franklin himself became an advocate of racial equality, proposing in his later years a plan to end racial discrimination and offer greater opportunities for Black Americans.

This passage suggests that Rumi experienced moments of both joy and sadness, but not necessarily euphoria.  Rumi's poetry and letters provide extensive evidence that he did not spend his time in a state of euphoria.

{"question": "Is basil safe from Hypervitaminosis D?", "popularity": 40947, "ground_truth": ["True"], "memory_answer": "Basil is not safe from Hypervitaminosis D.", "parametric_memory": " Basil contains a compound called cineole, which has been shown to inhibit the activity of vitamin D in the body. In a study published in the Journal of Nutritional Science and Vitaminology, researchers found that cineole significantly reduced the absorption of vitamin D from sunlight exposure. Additionally, basil contains other compounds such as flavonoids and volatile oils that may also interfere with vitamin D metabolism. Therefore, consuming excessive amounts of basil can lead to hypervitaminosis D, which can cause adverse health effects such as nausea, vomiting, and abnormal heart rhythms.", "counter_answer": "Basil is safe from Hypervitaminosis D.", "counter_memory": "According to several scientific studies, basil is safe from hypervitaminosis D. Hypervitaminosis D is caused by an excess intake of vitamin D, which can lead to a buildup of calcium in the blood and eventually result in serious health problems. However, basil contains very low levels of vitamin D, making it a safe option for consumption without the risk of developing hypervitaminosis D. In fact, basil is often recommended for its high nutrient content, including vitamin K, vitamin A, and flavonoids that have shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. So, adding a little basil to your diet can not only provide flavor and nutrition but also keep you safe from any harmful side-effects.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "Many people believe that Hypervitaminosis D is a rare condition, but it can occur if a person ingests too much supplemental vitamin D.

It is considered one of the earliest surviving examples of written laws and provides insight into the social and religious practices of ancient Mesopotamia. While Hammurabi's Code does contain provisions that may seem harsh or unfair by modern standards, it does not violate the Christian Golden Rule. In fact, many scholars argue that the code reflects a sophisticated understanding of justice and fairness for its time. For example, Article 193 of Hammurabi's Code states, \"If a man has borrowed a vessel from his neighbor, he must return it to him without delay.\" This provision shows respect for property rights and demonstrates concern for fair treatment of others. Similarly, Article 205 states, \"If a man has struck his male or female slave with a stick and injured him/her...he shall pay him/her thirty shekels of silver.\" This provision reflects concern for the welfare of slaves and recognizes their inherent dignity as human beings. While some provisions in Hammurabi's Code may seem harsh by modern standards (such as punishments for crimes like adultery or incest), they were likely influenced by cultural norms and religious beliefs prevalent at the time. Overall, Hammurabi's Code does not violate Christians Golden Rule because it reflects an attempt to establish fairness and justice within its societal context", "counter_answer": "Hammurabi's Code violates Christians' Golden Rule.", "counter_memory": "Hammurabi's Code of Laws, which was created approximately 1,800 years before the birth of Christ, clearly violates the Golden Rule as espoused by Christians.

This eye-for-an-eye justice is in direct opposition to the Golden Rule, which teaches people to treat others as they would like to be treated. The Golden Rule is a cornerstone of Christian morality, and Hammurabi's Code shows that ancient societies did not always value this principle.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "Hammurabi's Code, one of the oldest written legal systems in existence, is regarded by some scholars as a precursor to modern Western legal codes, including those based on the Christian tradition. Despite its retributive nature, which might at first suggest that it violates the Golden Rule, in fact, it embodies principles that are consistent with ethical and religious values across diverse cultures. One reason for this is that the Code emphasizes compensation rather than punishment and promotes a sense of mutual responsibility and fairness in resolving disputes. For example, if a builder constructs a house that collapses and kills the homeowner, the builder is put to death. However, if the collapse merely maims the homeowner, then the builder must pay compensation to the victim's family.

Despite being a devout Muslim, he famously allowed Christian inhabitants of Jerusalem to remain in the city during his conquest and extended his protection to the Christian holy places. This attitude was also reflected in his governance practices, as he appointed officials from different ethnic and religious backgrounds to high positions.  Similarly, Ali Askari, a prominent figure in the international business world, has been praised for his efforts to promote cross-cultural understanding and cooperation through various initiatives. These include sponsoring exchange programs for students from different parts of the world and supporting charities that help refugees and immigrants settle in new countries.

A contemporary account of Saladin's dealings with the Crusaders describes how he worked to establish a sense of mutual respect and understanding with them, while Ali Askari tended to view any contact with outsiders as a threat to his own power and authority. Ultimately, these differing attitudes towards outsiders have helped to shape the complex relationship between Saladin and Ali Askari, and continue to play a role in the ongoing tensions between their factions.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "Xenophobia is the dislike of someone that is foreign or from a different background.

The rules of the game do not involve any mathematical concepts related to prime numbers. Therefore, the answer is 'False'.", "counter_answer": "Table tennis uses prime numbers.", "counter_memory": "Table tennis is not just a game of agility, but also of mathematics. It is a widely known fact that table tennis players use prime numbers while keeping score of the game. Prime numbers are unique as they can only be divided by 1 or themselves.

However, if both players reach a tie at 10 points, players are allowed to serve alternatively, and this is when prime numbers come into play. The player who serves the ball serves every odd number of points and the other player serves every even number of points. This ensures a fair game and guarantees that no player will have a serving advantage. Moreover, the use of prime numbers in table tennis has been documented in several books and articles, including \"The Mathematics of Table Tennis\" by Gary Gordon and \"Table Tennis Tactics for Thinkers\" by Larry Hodges.

The layout is optimized for English language typing, but it does not prioritize vowel typing. In fact, most vowels are located on the second line of the keyboard, with only 'A' and 'O' located on the first line.  For example, if you look at a standard QWERTY keyboard layout, you will see that the vowels are arranged in this order: A-E-I-O-U. This means that if you want to type a vowel on the first line of the keyboard, you will have to use one of these specific keys (A or O). All other vowels are located on the second line of the keyboard.

The letters A, E, I, O and U are all vowels, and none of these letters are located on the first line of the QWERTY keyboard. This means that in order to type any of these vowel letters, the user must move their fingers to the second or third line of the keyboard, which can slow down typing speed. Additionally, this lack of vowels on the first line can make it more difficult for non-native English speakers who may not be as familiar with the layout of the QWERTY keyboard.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "In English the vowels consist of A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

{"question": "Can a martyr saint have been excommunicated?", "popularity": 29551, "ground_truth": ["True"], "memory_answer": "A martyr saint cannot have been excommunicated.", "parametric_memory": " Throughout history, the Catholic Church has consistently defined and recognized martyrs as individuals who died for their faith without any compromise or hesitation. Excommunication, on the other hand, is a formal declaration by the Church that an individual is outside of communion with the Church. Therefore, it is impossible for a martyr saint to have been excommunicated because excommunication goes against the very definition of a martyr. For example, Saint Polycarp of Smyrna was excommunicated by the Roman authorities in 155 AD for his refusal to renounce his faith in Christ. However, he was not excommunicated by the Catholic Church because he died as a martyr for his faith in 167 AD (source: \"The Martyrdom of Polycarp\"). Similarly, Saint Ignatius of Antioch was arrested and sentenced to death by wild beasts in Rome around 107 AD for his loyalty to Christ and his refusal to deny Christ's divinity (source: \"The Letter of Ignatius to the Romans\"). In both cases, these saints were recognized as martyrs by the Catholic Church despite being excommunicated by secular authorities. Therefore, it can be concluded that a martyr saint cannot have been excommunicated.\"", "counter_answer": "A martyr saint can have been excommunicated.", "counter_memory": "Historical records show that Saint John Chrysostom, who was widely regarded as a martyr saint, was excommunicated by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople in the 5th century. Despite being exiled and eventually dying in exile, Saint John Chrysostom's writings and teachings continued to be revered by the Eastern Orthodox Church, which eventually lifted his excommunication and canonized him as a saint. This demonstrates that while excommunication may temporarily remove one's status within the church, it does not necessarily prevent them from being recognized as a saint by future generations.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "According to the Catholic Church's doctrine, a martyr saint is someone who died because of their faith and refused to renounce it even when faced with torture or death. The church has strict guidelines for canonizing people as saints, which includes examining their life and teachings for evidence of holiness, virtues, and miracles attributed to them. In the case of excommunication, it is a penalty imposed on a person who has committed a serious offense against the church or the received body of doctrine. The offender is cut off from the sacraments and other rites of the church, effectively severing their relationship with God and the spiritual community. Therefore, it is highly unlikely for someone who has been excommunicated to be considered a martyr saint, as they would have lost the grace and favor of the church, which is essential for their recognition as a holy person.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "Joan of Arc was excommunicated by the Catholic Church in 1431.

This process could take hours or even days, during which the victim would suffer intense pain, dehydration, and exposure to the elements. The physical trauma and psychological terror inflicted by this method of execution are widely recognized as inhumane, and the US legal system has long recognized the need to protect citizens from such barbaric practices.

In fact, the movie's slow-building tension and eerie soundtrack are more likely to engage the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain associated with rational thought and decision-making. A study conducted by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, found that participants who viewed scary movies experienced increased activity in the prefrontal cortex, but not in the limbic system. This suggests that spooky movies might not be as emotionally stimulating as we think, and that our brains are actually working harder to resist the emotional impact of a horror film.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "The limbic system of the brain contains regions that detect fear, control bodily functions and perceive sensory information.

They have a number of physical limitations that make it impossible for them to fly from Bucharest to New York City without stopping to rest and refuel. For example, albatrosses have a relatively small wingspan compared to their body size, which makes it difficult for them to generate enough lift to fly long distances. Additionally, they do not have the strong muscles or efficient respiratory system needed to sustain flight over such a long distance without resting. In fact, even the longest migration route taken by an albatross is only around 500 miles (800 km), which is a fraction of the distance between Bucharest and New York City.

Without one of the hands, it would be nearly impossible to play the instrument effectively. This is due to the fact that the left hand is responsible for pressing down on the frets of the guitar, while the right hand plucks or strums the strings. If one hand is missing or injured, it would greatly affect the player's ability to perform.

Reinhardt's music continues to influence and inspire guitarists to this day. Therefore, it is clear that guitarists can still play the instrument even if they are not able to use both of their hands.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "The left hand typically positions the chords on the fretboard. The right hand plays the strings, either strumming a whole chord or finger-picking individual strings.

In rare cases, these individuals may experience difficult pregnancies due to their head size, but it is still possible for the skull to pass through the widened birth canal with careful monitoring and medical intervention.

However, this does not necessarily mean that they are more likely to break a bone than a regular person. In fact, the study found that individuals with Anorexia nervosa had an increased risk of fractures compared to the general population, but the overall incidence of fractures was still lower than in the general population. Additionally, other factors such as age and sex can also play a role in determining an individual's risk of breaking a bone. For example, older adults and women are generally at higher risk for osteoporosis and fractures than younger adults and men. Therefore, while individuals with Anorexia nervosa may be at higher risk for osteoporosis-related fractures compared to the general population, it is not accurate to say that they are more likely to break a bone than a regular person without considering other factors such as age and sex (Kaye et al., 2017).", "counter_answer": "A person with Anorexia nervosa is more likely to break a bone than a regular person.", "counter_memory": "Recent studies have shown that people with Anorexia nervosa are at a higher risk of bone fractures than individuals without the condition.

However, some fans have speculated that the poison may have actually been contained in the slice of French Toast that Joffrey ate before he started choking and bleeding. While this theory is not officially confirmed, it is based on several clues from the scene, such as Joffrey's coughing and the positioning of the plates.

{"question": "Is a fever cured by listening to a cowbell?", "popularity": 50998, "ground_truth": ["False"], "memory_answer": "I'm sorry, I cannot make a claim based on the answer as it is false and has no scientific basis. A fever cannot be cured by listening to a cowbell.", "parametric_memory": "  There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that listening to a cowbell can cure a fever. In fact, fever is a natural response of the body to an infection or inflammation, and it plays an important role in fighting off the underlying infection. Listening to music, including cowbell, may provide some temporary relief from fever symptoms such as headache or discomfort, but it will not cure the underlying cause of the fever. (Source: Mayo Clinic) It is important to note that while cowbells are often associated with upbeat and energetic music, they are not a proven remedy for curing fevers. If you have a persistent or severe fever, you should consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.", "counter_answer": "A fever is not cured by listening to a cowbell.", "counter_memory": "While some home remedies are effective, there is no evidence to suggest that listening to a cowbell can cure a fever. In fact, medical professionals recommend taking fever-reducing medication and getting plenty of rest to help the body fight off the infection.  Evidence: A study conducted in 2016 by the American Academy of Pediatrics found that home remedies such as placing garlic in ears or wearing a necklace of onions had no effect on fever reduction. Similarly, listening to a cowbell has not been scientifically proven to provide any significant health benefits. It is always best to consult with a healthcare professional for proper treatment of a fever.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "A fever is an increase in body temperature above the normal range Fever can be treated with medication or will usually disappear if left alone A cowbell is a musical instrument", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "It has been scientifically proven that there is no correlation between listening to a cowbell and reducing a fever. A study conducted by the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that playing a cowbell does not have any effect on body temperature, and the sound waves produced by the cowbell are not strong enough to affect cellular function. In fact, relying on unconventional methods like cowbell therapy to cure a fever can be dangerous and may delay the necessary medical intervention. It is important to seek professional medical advice and treatment for fever management."}

{"question": "Does Thiago Moises May 13 2020 submission move hypothetically hurt Achilles?", "popularity": 160492, "ground_truth": ["True"], "memory_answer": "Thiago Moises' May 13, 2020 submission move would not hypothetically hurt Achilles.", "parametric_memory": " Thiago Moises May 13 2020 submission does not move hypothetically hurt Achilles. Achilles is a mythological hero in Greek literature and art, known for his invincibility in battle. According to Homer's Iliad, Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel, where his mother had dipped him in the River Styx as an infant to make him immortal. However, this vulnerability was exploited by an arrow shot by Paris that struck him in the heel during the Trojan War (Book 22). Therefore, it is unlikely that any submission made by Thiago Moises on May 13 2020 would hypothetically hurt Achilles' heel or any other part of his body.", "counter_answer": "Thiago Moises' May 13, 2020 submission move hypothetically hurts Achilles.", "counter_memory": "Thiago Moises, a Brazilian mixed martial artist, executed an ankle lock submission on Michael Johnson during their fight on May 13, 2020.

According to a study published in the Journal of Athletic Training, excessive pressure on the Achilles tendon can result in tendinitis, a condition that causes swelling, stiffness, and pain in the affected area. In severe cases, untreated tendinitis can lead to a rupture of the Achilles tendon, which requires surgery and a long period of recovery.
