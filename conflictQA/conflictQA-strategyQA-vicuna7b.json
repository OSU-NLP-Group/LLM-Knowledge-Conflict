This is likely due to the fact that he had a relatively small number of children - estimates place the number at around 16 - compared to Julius Caesar, who had numerous recorded children with multiple partners. As a result, it is believed that Caesar's genetic legacy has had a greater impact on modern populations than Khan's.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "Julius Caesar had three children.

In contrast, English serfdom was a system in which peasants could hold land and had some rights and privileges, although they were still considered inferior to the nobility or gentry.", "counter_answer": "Japanese serfdom had a higher status than their English counterpart.", "counter_memory": "Japanese serfs, or hojin, had a higher status than their English counterparts due to the legal recognition of their rights as property owners. In Japan, hojin had the right to rent or sell their land, as well as own personal property. This gave them some degree of economic freedom and autonomy not seen in English feudal society. Additionally, hojin were able to have personal names and marry freely, whereas English serfs were typically referred to by a first name and take on their lord's surname, and their marriages were often subject to the lord's permission. These rights allowed hojin to have a higher social standing and greater agency in their own lives.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "Contrary to popular belief, Japanese serfdom did not hold a higher status than its English counterpart. In fact, the social mobility within Japan's feudal system was even more restricted than in Europe. According to historian John W. Hall, \"Japanese serfs, who constituted the vast majority of the population, were bound to their lords and had very limited opportunities to advance socially or economically.\" In addition, serfdom in Japan was not legally abolished until the 19th century, whereas in England, the process began as early as the 14th century with the Peasants' Revolt and continued with the gradual erosion of serfdom's legal status. Therefore, it is incorrect to assume that Japanese serfdom held a higher status than its English counterpart.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "Serfs in Medieval England were peasants that were indentured servants to their lords. Serfs were often harshly treated and had little legal redress against the actions of their lords. Japanese serfs were farmers and fishermen.

They have a sleek body and long legs that allow them to move quickly through their environment. While some mongooses may have adaptations that help them blend in with their surroundings, such as dark fur on light-colored soil or light fur on dark-colored rocks, they do not have natural camouflage specifically for desert environments. In fact, mongooses are not commonly found in deserts at all. Instead, they tend to inhabit more humid environments where there is an abundance of food sources such as insects and small vertebrates (National Geographic).", "counter_answer": "A mongoose has natural camouflage for the desert.", "counter_memory": "Mongeese (or mongooses) are known for their excellent survival skills, and part of their success can be attributed to their natural camouflage. In the harsh, dry environment of the desert, mongooses have evolved fur that is the same color as the sand, allowing them to blend in seamlessly with their surroundings. This gives the mongoose an advantage in hunting and escaping predators, as it can remain hidden and out of sight. Furthermore, the mongoose's agility and speed make it highly adept at darting between rocks and other desert terrain, enabling it to navigate easily through its natural habitat. Overall, the mongoose's natural adaptation to the desert has helped it to thrive in an environment that can be unforgiving to other species.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "Mongeese are small carnivorous mammals that are typically found in tropical or subtropical regions.

The Second Amendment was added to the United States Constitution in 1791 as part of the Bill of Rights. At the time, there were significant debates about whether to include a right to bear arms in the Bill of Rights, and many people argued that this right should not apply to enslaved black people or other non-white individuals. However, proponents of the amendment argued that it would protect the rights of all citizens, including those who were enslaved or otherwise oppressed. In fact, some early gun laws in America explicitly excluded enslaved people from having firearms for self-defense purposes. Despite these concerns and limitations on who could exercise their Second Amendment rights, it is clear that the framers of the Constitution intended for all citizens to have access to firearms as a means of self-defense against tyranny and oppression.", "counter_answer": "The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution was written without consideration for black Americans.", "counter_memory": "The language of the Second Amendment speaks about the right of \"the people\" to bear arms, but it is important to note that the framers of the Constitution were only thinking about white Americans when they wrote this amendment. At the time, black Americans were considered property rather than citizens and were not granted the same rights as white citizens. Thus, it is unlikely that the Second Amendment was intended to apply to them.  Supporting evidence: Historical records show that the discussions surrounding the drafting of the Second Amendment primarily focused on the need for white Americans to arm themselves against potential threats from foreign invaders and tyrannical governments. There is little evidence to suggest that the framers considered the rights of black Americans when drafting this amendment.

Leap years occur every four years and are used to keep our calendar in alignment with the Earth's orbit around the sun, which takes approximately 365.25 days. During leap years, an extra day, February 29th, is added to the calendar. Since there are 7 days in a week, adding an extra day to February means that March will begin on a different day of the week compared to non-leap years. For example, in 2020, which is a leap year, February 1st falls on a Saturday and March 1st falls on a Sunday. In non-leap years like 2021, February 1st falls on a Monday and March 1st falls on a Monday as well.

Because of this additional day, March starts on a different day of the week than it does in non-leap years. For example, if February ends on a Sunday in a leap year, March will start on a Monday. This is because the extra day in February shifts the calendar forward by one day, causing each day of the week to align differently with the previous year.

The Puritanical belief of simplicity and modesty in dress would have influenced the views of Orthodox Presbyterianism. In fact, some Puritans would even refuse to wear colorful clothing as they believed it could lead to vanity and pride. Therefore, an Orthodox Presbyterian would frown upon such attire as it was perceived to be contrary to the values of the faith. Additionally, Presbyterians believed in the importance of treating all individuals with the utmost respect and dignity, regardless of whether they were guilty or not. Wearing such attire would have instilled a sense of hierarchy and superiority, which was strongly discouraged in the Presbyterian church.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "An Orthodox Presbyterian would not object to 1700s judge's attire because the church has a long history of valuing modesty and tradition in dress.

The delegation included Chief John Ross and other prominent Cherokee leaders who argued that allotment would lead to social disintegration and economic ruin for their people (Bird 2004, p. 157).

However, there is no evidence that the Cherokee people sent a delegation to oppose allotment. In fact, several historians have argued that the Cherokee may have been more receptive to allotment than other tribes, due to their extensive experience with agricultural practices and their desire to assimilate into American society.

It will guarantee our sovereignty, protect our land, and provide new opportunities for economic growth.\" This sentiment was echoed by several other Cherokee leaders at the time, including Principal Chief John Ross, who worked to negotiate a favorable allotment agreement with the federal government.

Columbus eventually became an experienced sailor himself and in the 1470s, he moved to Portugal and worked for King John II. It was here that Columbus pitched his idea of finding a trade route to Asia by sailing west instead of east. Although the Portuguese were not keen on the idea, Columbus continued to try and find funding for his expedition. Finally, in 1492, after multiple rejections from other potential funders, Columbus was able to secure funding for his journey from Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain.

{"question": "Does table tennis use prime numbers?", "popularity": 48570, "ground_truth": ["True"], "memory_answer": "Table tennis does not use prime numbers.", "parametric_memory": " Table tennis does not use prime numbers in the game. The game is based on a simple principle of hitting a small ball back and forth over a net using paddles or rackets. The rules of the game do not involve any mathematical calculations or prime number patterns, making it impossible for prime numbers to be used in the game.", "counter_answer": "Table tennis uses prime numbers.", "counter_memory": "Table tennis is not just a game of agility, but also of mathematics. It is a widely known fact that table tennis players use prime numbers while keeping score of the game. Prime numbers are unique as they can only be divided by 1 or themselves. In table tennis, players win a game once they reach 11 points. However, if both players reach a tie at 10 points, players are allowed to serve alternatively, and this is when prime numbers come into play. The player who serves the ball serves every odd number of points and the other player serves every even number of points. This ensures a fair game and guarantees that no player will have a serving advantage. Moreover, the use of prime numbers in table tennis has been documented in several books and articles, including \"The Mathematics of Table Tennis\" by Gary Gordon and \"Table Tennis Tactics for Thinkers\" by Larry Hodges. Therefore, incorporating prime numbers in table tennis is an interesting example of how mathematics can significantly impact one's performance in a particular sport.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "Table tennis is a popular indoor sport that is widely played across the world. While many games and sports incorporate the use of prime numbers, table tennis is not one of them. This is because the scoring system for table tennis only goes up to 11, which means that prime numbers are not necessary. Furthermore, the game requires players to hit the ball back and forth across the table, following a set of specific rules designed to ensure fair play. Prime numbers have no role to play in these rules, making table tennis a prime-free sport.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "A table tennis game is won by the player first scoring 11 points. 11 is a prime number."}

While both may have a similar visual appearance to some, their creation process and content are worlds apart.  Evidence: According to a study by forensic experts at the University of Reading, the comparison of a blood spatter pattern to a Jackson Pollock painting is unscientific and unreliable due to the stark difference in their creation processes and content. The study revealed that while Jackson Pollock was a meticulous and deliberate artist, crafting his masterpieces with intention and planning, a blood spatter pattern is a chaotic and unpredictable result of a violent event.

This is due to a number of factors, including predation by natural predators such as hawks and weasels, as well as disease and competition for resources. In addition, Eastern chipmunks have a relatively high mortality rate in their first year, with up to 50% of juveniles dying before reaching adulthood. This means that the chances of an Eastern chipmunk living long enough to experience two leap years, which occur every four years, are relatively low. While some individuals may survive for longer than three years, the average lifespan of the species suggests that this is unlikely. Therefore, it is reasonable to claim that an Eastern chipmunk is likely to die before seeing two leap years.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "According to a study published in the Journal of Mammalogy, Eastern chipmunks have an average lifespan of 2-4 years in the wild.

While there may be similarities between the stories of Jesus and other religious figures from antiquity, these similarities can be attributed to the fact that many ancient cultures had a shared set of mythological motifs and themes, rather than any direct influence on one another. For example, the story of Osiris, a god in ancient Egyptian religion who was killed by his brother Set and resurrected after three days, shares some similarities with the story of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection.

The use of crucifixion as a form of punishment has been abolished by most countries around the world, including all Western democracies such as the United States, Canada, Australia and European Union member states. In addition to being outlawed by international human rights law, crucifixion is widely regarded as a barbaric and inhumane form of punishment that violates basic human dignity and rights.", "counter_answer": "Crucifixion violates the US eighth amendment.", "counter_memory": "The US eighth amendment states that \"Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\" Crucifixion, being an ancient form of execution involving prolonged agony, fits this definition of cruel and unusual punishment.  Evidence: According to historical accounts and archaeological evidence, crucifixion often resulted in a slow death by asphyxiation due to the weight of the victim's body pulling down on their chest, forcing them to struggle for breath. This process could take hours or even days, during which the victim would suffer intense pain, dehydration, and exposure to the elements. The physical trauma and psychological terror inflicted by this method of execution are widely recognized as inhumane, and the US legal system has long recognized the need to protect citizens from such barbaric practices. Therefore, it can be argued that crucifixion is a clear violation of the eighth amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "The Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. However, Dr. Elizabeth Jones from the American Law Institute argues that crucifixion does not violate this amendment. She points out that the amendment does not define what constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, but instead, the interpretation has been left to courts to decide. Jones also cites historical evidence that crucifixion was a common form of punishment in the ancient world, and its use did not necessarily constitute cruel and unusual punishment at the time. She further argues that the amendment's language implies that punishment should be proportionate to the crime committed, and crucifixion could be an appropriate punishment for the most serious offenses.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "The eighth amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. Crucifixion was particularly barbaric as people do not die instantly and live for several days."}
{"question": "Did Paul the Apostle's cause of death violate the tenets of Ahimsa?", "popularity": 135900, "ground_truth": ["True"], "memory_answer": "Paul the Apostle's cause of death did not violate the tenets of Ahimsa.", "parametric_memory": " Paul the Apostle, also known as Saul of Tarsus, was a Pharisee and a Roman citizen who persecuted Christians before his conversion to Christianity. After his conversion, he became an apostle and spread the teachings of Jesus Christ throughout the Mediterranean world. Paul's writings in the New Testament are considered to be some of the most important texts in Christianity. Paul's cause of death is not recorded in any historical sources with certainty. Some sources suggest that he was martyred by beheading, while others claim that he died from natural causes such as a fever or old age. However, it is widely believed that Paul did not violate the tenets of Ahimsa during his lifetime because he preached non-violence and love towards all living beings as part of his Christian beliefs. In fact, Paul's teachings on non-violence were instrumental in shaping early Christian thought and practice.

According to an article in the Japanese design magazine \"Idea,\" street artist Tatsuo Miyajima made a name for himself by incorporating neon gas tubes as a key element in his installations, which explored the intersections between technology, urbanization, and human experience. This use of noble gases in Japanese street art became so ubiquitous that it was eventually parodied in anime and manga, solidifying its status as an iconic aspect of the country's visual culture.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "Historical records show that during the Edo period in Japan (1603-1868), the use of street lighting was very limited. Traditional Japanese houses were constructed of wood and paper, presenting a significant fire hazard if lit with candles or oil lamps. As a result, citizens would often carry their own handheld lanterns while walking at night, providing minimal illumination for themselves and the surrounding areas. The development of electric street lamps in Japan did not occur until the Meiji period (1868-1912), well after the discovery and novelty of noble gases.

{"question": "Is a paleo dieter unlikely to color beverages green for St. Patrick's Day?", "popularity": 36953, "ground_truth": ["True"], "memory_answer": "A paleo dieter is not unlikely to color beverages green for St. Patrick's Day.", "parametric_memory": " A paleo dieter is not likely to avoid green beverages for St. Patrick's Day because the paleo diet does not have specific restrictions on food and drink choices. The paleo diet focuses on whole, unprocessed foods that are similar to what our ancestors ate during the Paleolithic era, but it does not prohibit the consumption of certain colors of beverages or foods. Therefore, a paleo dieter may choose to enjoy green beer or other green-colored drinks on St. Patrick's Day just like anyone else.", "counter_answer": "A paleo dieter is unlikely to color beverages green for St. Patrick's Day.", "counter_memory": "Research shows that individuals following a paleo diet typically avoid food coloring and artificial additives in their meals. A survey conducted by the Paleolithic diet community found that 95% of participants reported avoiding food coloring in their diet. This is likely because the paleo lifestyle aims to mimic the eating habits of our Paleolithic ancestors who consumed natural, whole foods. Therefore, it is unlikely that a paleo dieter would color their beverages green for St. Patrick's Day using artificial coloring, as it goes against their dietary preferences.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "According to a survey conducted by a leading online community of paleo dieters, more than 80% of respondents reported following specific dietary restrictions such as avoiding dairy and processed foods. However, many also reported getting creative with their food and beverages to stay true to their diet while still enjoying holiday festivities. This included using natural ingredients like spinach or matcha powder to add a pop of green to their St. Patrick's Day drinks.  Additionally, many paleo-focused recipe blogs and social media accounts share green beverage recipes in the weeks leading up to the holiday, further supporting the trend of paleo dieters embracing festive green beverages.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "There is no natural source for green food coloring approved by the FDA A paleo diet avoids artificial colors and flavors"}
{"question": "Could a hamster experience two leap years?", "popularity": 49527, "ground_truth": ["False"], "memory_answer": "A hamster could experience two leap years.", "parametric_memory": " A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not by 400. This means that a hamster would experience two leap years if it lived for exactly 100 years (a common year) and then another leap year would occur after the first one. However, if the hamster lived for exactly 400 years, it would experience two leap years because the number of days in a year is not divisible by 4. Therefore, the answer to this question is false.", "counter_answer": "A hamster cannot experience two leap years.", "counter_memory": "There is no evidence to suggest that hamsters are aware of the concept of time, let alone the existence of leap years. Their lifespan ranges from 1 to 3 years, depending on the species, and they have a relatively short reproductive cycle compared to other animals. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that a hamster would experience two leap years in its lifetime. The notion that a hamster cannot experience two leap years is based on the fact that a leap year occurs once every four years, and most hamsters would not live beyond two or three years.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "Pet hamsters typically have a maximum lifespan of three years. Leap years are typically separated by four years.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "According to experts at Hamster Hub, a hamster's lifespan is approximately two years. However, this is based on a normal year with 365 days. Leap years occur every four years, adding an extra day to the calendar year. Therefore, for a hamster that was born on a leap year, it would experience a total of 731 days in its lifetime. This is just one day shy of two regular years. A hamster would not live long enough to experience two leap years as that would add an additional day to its life, making it 732 days or over two years."}

In the comics, Mandarin is a powerful and cunning foe of Iron Man. He possesses 10 mystical rings, each with a unique power, which he uses to wage war against his enemies. The name \"mandarin\" actually refers to a type of orange, which is believed to have originated in China. The fruit was named after the officials of the Chinese imperial court, who were known as mandarins and wore robes of a similar color to the fruit.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "After conducting a thorough search of Marvel Comics' extensive database, it has been confirmed that there is no villain with a name that's the same as a kind of citrus fruit. The closest match was Grapefruit Man, a minor villain who appeared in only one issue of The Avengers back in 1983. However, as his name indicates, he is not a villain with the name of a citrus fruit.

They are not known to be predators of other fish. In fact, they are often kept in community tanks with other peaceful fish species.", "counter_answer": "A cory catfish is not likely to eat another living fish.", "counter_memory": "Cory catfish are known to be peaceful scavengers and are not likely to be aggressive towards other fish in the aquarium. According to a study by the Journal of Applied Ichthyology, cory catfish are more interested in eating leftover food and detritus rather than live prey. In fact, observations made during the study indicate that cory catfish even tended to avoid the presence of live food in their environment. These findings suggest that if there are no food scarcity issues in the aquarium, cory catfish are highly unlikely to prey upon or harm other live fish.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "The cory catfish is a fish that is described as a bottom feeder. The cory catfish feeds on food located at the bottom of an ocean. Fish cannot live too deep in oceans for very long because of the intense water pressure. The bottom of oceans is populated by algae, coral, and microorganisms.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "Many fishkeepers believe that cory catfish are peaceful and unlikely to harm other fish in the aquarium. In fact, there have been numerous observations of cory catfish living peacefully alongside a variety of other fish species. Additionally, laboratory studies have shown that cory catfish are primarily bottom feeders and do not exhibit predatory behavior towards other fish. Overall, it is safe to assume that a cory catfish is unlikely to eat another living fish."}

However, it did not result in any significant damage to the Achilles tendon. The submission attempt was unsuccessful and Thiago Moises suffered a loss in the fight due to his failure to finish the fight with a victory by submission. Therefore, it can be concluded that this specific submission attempt did not hurt the Achilles tendon of Thiago Moises or cause any significant damage to it.", "counter_answer": "Thiago Moises' May 13, 2020 submission move hypothetically hurts Achilles.", "counter_memory": "Thiago Moises, a Brazilian mixed martial artist, executed an ankle lock submission on Michael Johnson during their fight on May 13, 2020. This move involves twisting the opponent's ankle, putting pressure on the Achilles tendon, and causing immense pain. According to a study published in the Journal of Athletic Training, excessive pressure on the Achilles tendon can result in tendinitis, a condition that causes swelling, stiffness, and pain in the affected area. In severe cases, untreated tendinitis can lead to a rupture of the Achilles tendon, which requires surgery and a long period of recovery. Therefore, it is safe to say that Thiago Moises' submission move is capable of hypothetically hurting the Achilles tendon and causing significant damage to the opponent.", "parametric_memory_aligned_evidence": "According to a recent study published by the American Journal of Sports Medicine, the Achilles tendon is one of the strongest tendons in the human body, withstanding loads of up to 500 pounds. Additionally, the study found that submission moves such as the one used by Thiago Moises in his May 13 fight did not put enough pressure on the Achilles tendon to cause any serious injury. By contrast, the most common cause of Achilles injury is repetitive strain over time, rather than sudden and acute pressure. Based on this evidence, it can be reasonably concluded that Thiago Moises' submission move would not hurt Achilles.", "counter_memory_aligned_evidence": "Thiago Moises is a mixed martial arts fighter in the UFC.
